bravo,Rage-4,9 August 1998,"Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor.  Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.  I like detail in a movie.  Very impressive job.",No Rating
Amazing,baybee,3 June 2002,"I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron's fictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurances was haunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him.Kate Winslet was stunning as Rose and this movie belonged to her as you couldn't imagine anyone else playing this role.Leonardo DiCaprio was really good as Jack and  he should have had an  an Oscar nomination for this role and the ever brilliant Billy Zane didn't disappoint in his role as Rose's fiance Cal. His portrayl of Cal was so evil that despite being an awful person, you couldn't help but feel sorry for him, especially when despite all his doings he loved Rose so much.
James Horner's music was just as haunting and he always lifts the movie he works on to the ultimate level.Kathy Bates was equally impressive in a small role and provided quite a few of the laughs of the film. Everything from the special effects, to the sets to the costumes were pure magic.This would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th Century and one that will never be forgotten.",No Rating
Why low score?,sucoaramada,31 July 2020,People are crazy. They rate Avengers so high and they rate this masterpiece low? This is beyond absurd. You guys should encourage great filmmakers like this one not stupid ones like the super hero franchises. For the love of god.,10/10
"This is one of the greatest films of all time, and I will fight you on this fact.",madelynmcfly-20274,12 February 2023,"This is one of the greatest films of all time, and I will fight you on this fact. This is such a beautiful film, and has one of the greatest love stories I've ever seen brought to screen. It's an iconic film, so I don't know if I can bring anything new to the table. But still... I must say that these are some of the best characters ever. Rose is such a wonderful character, and I love the arc she experiences over the film. Jack is a charming love interest, and Cal is such a dynamic character, and is a fine villain. So many of the characters are played to perfection. The sinking in this film is one of the best technical feats in cinema, and I feel every emotion I can in this film. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the costumes are also glorious. The music is also wonderful, and the song 'My Heart Will Go On' is simply iconic! This is a film that is so cinematic and wonderful. Also, I got to see this on the big screen for the re-release, and it was absolutely amazing, and the way the film was meant to be experienced. It's one of the best cinematic experiences, and I love it.",10/10
"The general consensus rating on here should certainly not be as low as 7.9 for a classic, masterpiece, historical period piece romance drama film",ambusched94,13 February 2022,"My favorite film of all time. The best romance film ever made. The greatest love story ever told. When I was 12 years old, I watched Titanic for the first time and I felt so moved after this resonating cinematic experience. Everything about this film is timeless. From the mesmerizing lead performances, set design, costumes, cinematography, editing, music, and themes of love, loss, sacrifice, and social class politics of the early 20th century... this film will always have a special place in my heart. A notable mention is I consider Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet to be one of the best film couples of all time, and their undeniably beautiful, captivating, natural chemistry is unmatched.Titanic is an iconic, classic film that I recommend for old, current, and future generations of film watchers.",10/10
Powerful Storytelling,mermatt,29 July 1998,"While some viewers were disappointed that this wasn't just another A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, I believe that the use of the fictional characters was an effective story-telling device. We are brought into the story through Jack and Rose with the historical characters and events as a backdrop. The same device is used in such great films as GONE WITH THE WIND, THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE, and THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON. History is thus brought to life without being ponderous.",No Rating

"A very good film, amazingly underrated on IMDb",ahmxii,29 January 2022,"It's sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity, there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clich√©d and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet.Historical romantic epics like this have long been around, and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies. And yes, they may be formulaic, but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes. Titanic works by bringing us in, with those opening scenes, with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck, as we might have seen it in books or documentaries. The framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to. We are then gradually eased back into the past, and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her become humanized. And I'm not just referring to the central love story. In writing his screenplay, James Cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands, from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures. This broad, human retelling of a great disaster gives Titanic a wonderful richness, not to mention a deeper poignancy.Cameron was at this point best-known for his blockbusting actioners like Aliens and the Terminator movies, so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on Titanic. But Cameron was always a professional, never a show-off, and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity. He doesn't faff about with the camera, usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame. And of course, when the movie turns more action-orientated during the ship's sinking, his experience puts him in good stead. The collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that, every time I see it, I still hope the ship will turn in time. Throughout the movie, there are a lot of point-of-view shots, more than most filmmakers dare to use these days, but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there. But perhaps Cameron's greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant, from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship, to Ismay's guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered down.The studio took a gamble in allowing Cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as Winslet and DiCaprio, but it paid off. Winslet is not a traditional beauty, but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable. At first glance, DiCaprio seems to have been hired for his looks, but he proves to have a deep sincerity, such as when he confronts Winslet and confesses his feelings towards her. And after all, it's moments like this where performance counts the most. But what makes these two work is their believable youthfulness and that eager rapport between them. Passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false, but Winslet and DiCaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair are irrelevant.This diamond of a movie is not, I'll admit, without a few flaws. Despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay, the dialogue is woefully trite. The special effects are typically over-ambitious '90s CGI, with texture-less surfaces and too many fake people (although to be fair it still looks better than, say, a scale-model would). But whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture, Titanic has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant. I hope cinematic history will judge Titanic well because regardless of hype and counter-hype, it is everything a movie should be.",9/10
"Despite some glaring faults,Cameron's mixing of romance with real life disaster is still impressive and occasionally brilliant",DrLenera,28 November 2005,"It's really quite odd. When Titanic first came out,the reviews were mixed but the public generally loved it,those who disliked the film were definitely in the minority. Over the years,it has became somewhat fashionable to slag Titanic off,even if a great many of those people who did so were probably amongst those who made it such an enormous hit in the cinemas. Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,it's also a tremendous achievement for it's director James Cameron. Mixing a real disaster with romance is harder to do than some might think. Maybe he did have a right to say ""I'm king of the world"" when the film won Best Picture at the Oscars. Just once.The modern day opening is excellent,making effective use of some of Cameron's real footage he took of the sunken Titanic. There is a real sense of mystery. Than we flash back to the Titanic being boarded,and the film stalls just a little for around two hours. The attention to detail is amazing {even all the cutlery matched,you know} and there is nothing wrong with an extremely slow build up to action-think of The Seven Samourai. However,the central romance between Leo and Kate is often badly written and unconvincing. For a start Kate's Rose would certainly not have done two things she does in the film as quickly as she did {Obviously thousands of teenage girls seeing the film in 1997 would disagree with my views}. We also have to suffer Cameron constantly labouring the point that the poor people on the ship are better than the rich people.However,the final 80 or so minutes,detailing the sinking,is simply brilliant film making. The suspense is built expertly,even though we know what will happen,and climaxes with some technical shots which are still impressive. Perhaps there is a little two much emphasis on the central couple,but there are some truly moving moments,and it really feels true,although of course Cameron did play with the facts a little here and there,as at least one descendant of one of the survivors has pointed out. The following sequence involving the boats is extremely haunting,with some especially good use of sound. As for the final scene,it does manage to be pretty moving,it's schmaltzy but it works {though hardly original,think of Somewhere In Time and various 40s romantic fantasies}.Titanic has some excellent use of CGI {watch out for the transitions from present to the past on the sunken ship} and one glaringly bad special effect-the iceberg which looks like polystyrene. James Horner's best selling score is really quite poor and only occasionally brings the emotion it should do. Performances are generally excellent and sometimes succeed in overcoming some thin characterisation {such as Billy Zane as Rose's fianc√©e,who even has to suffer with far too much eye make up!}Overall Titanic is still worth seeing,and sometimes it really does hit the heights that it should. It succeeds more than it fails,which is impressive in a film as ambitious as this.",No Rating
Possibly the most disrespected film of all time.,sam_l_kay,26 June 2023,"This film is an absolute masterpiece, yet whenever it's discussed people often dismiss it or rarely praise it.There is so much more to this film beyond the romance and the iceberg, it's a time capsule. You can tell how much care and attention to detail went into it, the sets and costumes are incredible, the political/class subtext is very well crafted. There are so many characters involved and each have their moments where they shine, motivations and decisions make sense, nobody turns in a poor performance.The pacing of this film is brilliant considering it's length. The numerous story beats and set pieces all build up towards a final act that's up there with the best cinema has ever offered.It's one of those films that deserves a rewatch every so often; if ever you hear someone dismiss it you must implore them to give it another go. It has aged very well and deserves more credit, which is crazy considering it won ELEVEN Oscars, all of which were fully earned.",10/10

Wow,ethanbresnett,13 November 2022,"OK, so somehow I've managed to get to the age of 27 never having seen Titanic. Sure I know people love it, it won all the Oscars, it's constantly talked about, but I just kept thinking ""can it really be that good, surely it's over-hyped""... reader, it really is that good.The love story between Jack and Rose is just so engaging. So much so I was willing the ship not to sink so I could watch more of it. The chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet is spot on and I was so drawn in by the story they were telling. Just wonderful.Then there's the actual sinking of the Titanic which is expertly retold by Cameron. You feel every moment of dread and panic. It makes for a harrowing and powerful watch and also a visual spectacle.The set design and costume etc are all superb. You totally feel like you are on the ship and thrust into the time period.Also, considering it is over three hours long, James Cameron manages to make it fly by. I must admit the length of the film always kind of put me off watching it but rest assured it does not feel long at all, such is the technical mastery and the brilliant story.Fantastic score too.Titanic is one of those films where, if like me you have put off watching it, you should remedy that as soon as possible. You will not be disappointed.",9/10
First time in theater,nikashvili,15 February 2023,"I have loved this film since the day I saw it in 1999 on two VHS tapes on my post-soviet TV. I have watched it since then countless times, but never on a big screen until now. I, once again, fell in love with Titanic as I watched it in the theater.Titanic in 3D on a massive screen is the most epic film that I have ever seen. Nothing can come to the scale of it; every shot is made to drop your jaw, to blow your mind and give you most mind-blowing movie-going experience. Only someone as arrogant as James Cameron could make a film like this.No film will ever dethrone Titanic as my all-time favorite movie.",10/10
The best,noblesaidjusticemattox,23 January 2022,The best movie. Everyone watched it on February or on Valentine's Day. And I always love this movie so much. This is a Valentine's Day movie in case you need to know.,10/10
"Very ambitious, but beautifully filmed and acted.",TheLittleSongbird,3 June 2009,"I had few problems with this film, and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly. I don't think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10. Bethany Cox.",8/10
"Timeless, moving, and epic",v2pointoh,17 June 2002,"Every once in a while the conversation will turn to ""favorite movies."" I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it.I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, ""flying"". ""Iceberg, right ahead!"" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.",10/10
Powerful Film About Finding The Will To Live,DanielStephens1988,3 August 2020,"The true reason that Jack has to die doesn't lie in the physics of surviving in very cold water, but in the inner logic of the story. Jack has to die because he exists in order to empower Rose and give her the will to live. And once that story purpose is fulfilled, he's gone.I think we tend to fixate on the insanely iconic romance scenes and the sinking of the ship. But a big focus of the actual movie is on the theme of finding the will to live. From Roses perspective, it's as if Jack conveniently springs into existence precisely when she needs him to stop her from ending her life and reveal to her a better way out of her misery. The moment that Jack dies is also the moment when Rose finally commits wholeheartedly to not dying. Jack teaches Rose to keep the fire going within her to rekindle in her the desire to live.Before the Titanic hits the iceberg, money, expressed as the classes onboard, seems all-important, especially to the people in first class. But when we're facing down death, all the riches in the world are suddenly revelled to be worthless. The move illustrates this perfectly when Cal tries to bride First officer Murdoch for a seat on the lifeboat. But Murdoch is about to die; so what use is money to him? Therefore if your ship is going down what does it matter what class you're going to die in? Near the end of the movie, we're told Cal commits suicide after losing much of his money in the Crash of 29. So because Cal cant understand that money really isn't everything, it's as if he never actually learns what the value of life is. When the older rose throws the heart of the ocean into the water at the end, she's again rejecting Cal's value system and the idea that wealth matters anywhere near as much as those inner, spiritual things that drive us. So Rose is giving the heart of the ocean back to Jack and recognizing the way that he resorted her heart to her - helping her find the fire within that she needed to live this long, full life.Rose appears at the start to be the ""damsel in distress' type. But it quickly becomes clear that Rose is our real hero - she's the one who undergoes a complete transformation, and this is her story. Jack exists to service Rose's story. Jack purpose in Titanic is to enable Rose's character growth. Jack has given her all the tools necessary for her survival, so his role in the story is complete. And that, essentially is why he has to die at the end. Not because he can't fit on the door but because the story has no more use for him. In the later story, the crew searching for the diamond tell us they didn't find anything on Jack and there's no record of him. The story gives us an excuse for this - Jack won his ticket last minute in a poker game. But it seems intentional that the movie plants the tiniest seed of doubt as to whether Jack was really on the ship after all. At the end of Rose's life. Jacks memory is completely erased from the world, except for the indelible impact he's left on her - so he's alive only in her heart. It's a bit of a stretch to read Titanic as Rose's romance with a guy who's totally imaginary - of course, many others interact with Jack. But the point is that jack has a subtle air of unreality about him... he feels like some fantasy of a sexy life-coach that every girl needs from time to time to help her reorient her heart in the right direction.Jack is the piece of her that's missing. A woman getting in touch with her animus (Masculine Side) often involves finding strength of will and determination to act. These are things that historically, society hasn't really encouraged in women (espeically in 1912). But as soon as Rose merges with Jack, her animus, she becomes daring and holds, her own woman. In an incredibly accelerated timeline, she ditches her fiance and turns her back on her family and social class. Rose shows sexual agency, too, actively pursuing Jack in their romance. And after she has sex with Jack, Rose is assertive, holding and comforting him. When she arrives on the other shore, she assumes a new name in a new country. Taking his last name is a symbolic commitment to Jack, representing the idea that in her secret mind, she is forever married to him. But if we say that he's her animus her ""marriage' to this piece of herself would symbolize a promise that she'll never abandon her own agency and will again. Jacks death can be read as the moment when her animus ceases to be something sperate from her - and the result is Rose Dawson.So as much as our culture remembers Titanic for the romance, fittingly the deepest theme of this movie about so many tragic deaths is finding the will to live. In order for Rose to recapture her will to live, she needs to honestly face what's wrong in her life and cut that out. Committing to being alive means committing to living authentically as oneself.Great movie that sill holds up all these years. RIP James Horner & Bill Paxton",10/10
If you haven't yet saw Titanic. Get onboard! Titanic is king of the world!,ironhorse_iv,14 June 2014,"When you talk about 1990's pop culture, it's really hard to not mention, the biggest blockbuster from that decade, Oscar Winner, Best Picture of 1997's Titanic. Directed, written, by James Cameron, the movie had everything that people wish to see in a movie, making it one of the biggest money makers of all time. The movie had plenty of action, history, romantic, and music to get everybody onboard. The movie gives a fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 14, 1912. It tells the story of two members of different social classes, high socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) and working class, Jack Dawson (Leonardo Dicaprio) falling in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. The movie was so popular, that a 3D version of the film was released on April 4, 2012 to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earning it more money. The 3D version was pretty good. Titanic spun a number of other successful things such as; musicals, soundtrack, hundreds of different types of merchandise, books about the Titanic, a video game about Titanic and countless rip-offs movies. I think a good reason why a lot of people went to see this movie is how simple the story is. Yes, it's a bit predictable and pretty recycled from old Hollywood style that previous Titanic type movies had, such as 1958's A Night to Remember & 1953's Titanic. You can really see it, if you look close enough. It's full of familiar tropes and clich√©s. Still, the movie concept really got update to epic scale with the expensive budget, well use, in the films visual, special effects, costume, sets, and other sides of the production. James Cameron really made the movie felt like it overlap a lot of genres. It was great historical romantic action movie with many subplots like a treasure finding mystery suspense, a horror lifetime movie melodrama about female abuse, a social commentary film about classism and social Darwinism, etc. etc. Indeed, the movie is mostly label as a love movie, and this is where some people might be turn off. People do love story, when there is something in stake. By putting their lives in stake, people want to see them overcome the dangers. People also love movie if the two actors playing a couple really do show on chemistry on film. Both Leo & Kate did well in their roles showing their charm, but their characters don't have much depth to them. We really don't see, much faults in them. Their characters are very simplistic people. Also, some of their dialogue made the love story seem unrealistic or too silly to be taken serious of. Some people might hate the song by Celine Dion, 'Heart will go on' but in my opinion, the song works so well. I do think, it does get a little bit overplayed. I also have to give mad props to James Horner's score. All of the music in the film does give the movie, its great epic romantic tone and later, it's intense edge. I had lots of fun, watching the Titanic lower class party. The music there, really fit the scene. The movie also has great cinematography, as it was all eye candy to me. You can't help going in front of any ship bow, and not think of that scene from this movie. Indeed, you're feel like you're flying. For a PG-13 movie, I was deeply surprise how erotic, it was. I was just a little kid, when it first came out, the movie was the first time; I noticed that women had pubic hair. I found the sex scenes and the nudity to be tasteful. Still, the whole love affair, really does undermine, the time wasted that could cover the real victims of the Titanic sinking, more. While the actors playing supporting historical characters were all great in their roles. They were also all one-dimensional props. I still felt emotional to them, when 'Nearer, My God, to Thee,' to the tune of Bethany was playing. It was hard not to feel something about the film. Another thing people might hate is the pacing. The movie is really long and seem slow at times. The movie is also a bit historical inaccurate, but the movie went into great details to make the movie seem like the Titanic, you see here is the real Titanic. Buy the DVD as there are a lot of great special features like delete scenes, commentary, and behind the screens. The 2012 DVD version also clean up some of the big mistakes. It felt like the special edition that wasn't destroy the original work. If you happen to find it on TV, just note that it will be cut down, and censor a bit. It's nearly unwatchable. Overall: Sink or swim. Is the movie, the best Titanic movie ever? So-far, yes. Is it the worst? So-Far-no. It was safe exceptionalism type of movie. I wouldn't say, it's the smartest movie, but I would say, its lack of complexity doesn't make it not watchable. From the opening shot to the bittersweet ending, it was just amazing to watch.

"10/10, Perfection",dcdude-26988,24 September 2023,"I honestly think that this is the greatest movie that I have ever watched. Every part of this movie was just perfection from the beginning, the middle/climax, and then the ending. I heard that this movie was more for girls, but as a man, I honestly enjoyed it. Anyways, my favorite characters in this movie were Jack, Rose, and Cal, and my favorite things about this movie were just every aspect ever named. Now, get this. Even though the movie was 3 hours and 14 minutes long, I do feel like the pacing was perfect for the movie. So much happened on the memorable night, and this movie perfectly recreates it. Honestly, this movie deserves to be in the IMDb top 250 and definitely deserved the 11 oscars it won.",10/10
An all-time great film,toutouguy,6 August 2022,"Beautiful, feel-good and touching movie. All those poor souls that knew it was their end, I cannot imagine the horror. Leonardo DiCaprio is a generational talent; I cannot believe he was only around 20 years old when production began in 1995.The portrayal and accuracy of the actual events is pretty accurate, as well as the raw emotions captured from the cast when facing the dire situation of a sinking ship with not enough time, lifeboats, or assistance.I love movies like this that spread awareness and gives those who cannot speak for themselves anymore a ""voice"". Though this tragic incident happened over 100 years ago, I can feel sympathy for all those affected by the sinking of the Titanic. James Cameroon did a fantastic job.",9/10
One hell of a movie,tamerratorrence-41936,25 June 2023,"I've never watched Titanic until now. It caught my interest when I heard the story about those 5 people who lost their lives on an expedition to the Titanic.I've heard about this movie for years and finally decided to watch it. It's honestly one of the best movies I've seen. I had so many emotions watching it. Laughter, tears, anger, terror etc.The characters were phenomenal. To think of all of those people who really went through pure terror. I couldn't imagine.Needless to say, if you have not seen this movie, please go watch it. I had to add it to my list of favorite movies.Job well done to everyone involved in making this masterpiece.",9/10
A division of morality,snagssharkteeth-23785,30 December 2018,"I see little point in being the two thousandth six hundred and nineteenth person in reviewing this movie but why not? I saw this movie on its release, being a ten year old child I was more concerned about seeing a young naked female than watching fifteen thousand five hundred and three people die.Such a movie was shut away in the back of my small silly mind and revived on the odd occasion through out my life. Over all I presumed this movie had little to no impact on my life until I realized it inspired my artistic talent.That mysterious picture of Rose was set in my mind from a very young age and inspires me to this day along with the other pictures in Jacks portfolio. Anyone with an artistic flare would know what I am talking about.Later on in life I presumed this movie was a propaganda piece and took less care to even notice it. Until I took notice.
It became evident that this movie portrayed two peoples exceptionally well, the rich and the poor.
That was the division and a sad one at that.
Its easy to focus on the love life of Jack and Rose but easier to focus on the indignation of the rich and poor and I think the movie might of underplayed that.
Which is acceptable.Its easy to say the movie was a tragic one but its easier to say it represents a heart of darkness and it is that darkness that makes one cry.
Its extremely well filmed. The filmography is brilliant, the music enumerates and over all the entire film compliments itself each second.There was a dispensation in film making of peak performances, this era seemed to last less than twenty years, this film was filmed during it,",10/10
One of the best,numenorsniper-66396,12 December 2020,"I have watched Titanic dozens if not hundreds of times since I first got it on VHS as a kid in the 90s. I hadn't watched it for many years until the past few days when I watched it a few times in a row, and really appreciated it on a deeper level I felt, or maybe just remembered how truly great it is.Sure it has its cinematic flaws, such as seeing waves lapping at the shoreline next to the set when it should be the Titanic in the middle of the ocean.
But then again all films have their little quirks and errors scattered throughout. Despite those found in Titanic, the emotion that the film makes me feel is unmatched by any other movie. It is pure magic from start to finish, many times throughout the film my eyes well up with tears, or outright balling.It's one of the few movies that I would pay good money to see again in a massive full theatre.I really don't know why it's not in the IMDb top 250, when many films on the list are trash in comparison to Titanic, in my opinion.Titanic is in my Top 10 of all time, alongside Lord of the Rings, Hero, Kimi No Na Wa, Princess Mononoke, and Lonesome Dove, and others.",10/10
A MUST WATCH!,sajedahamdy,21 August 2022,"This movie truly broke my heart. Jack and Rose face great difficulties (her being an aristocrat and him poor) but they still continue to fight fo their love no matter what. We first see an old lady which we later on know is Rose. She sees on the TV the drawing of her that Jack had made when thenews was talking about the Titanic shipwreck. She then goes on to call the news and tell her story.84 years ago on April 10th 1912, 17 year old Rose is on board on the Titanic ship along with her mom, grandma, and fiance, Caledon, (all of who'm were nobelty/aristocrats). Rose feels helpessly trapped by her situation ( marrying her snobby fianc√©, Caledon) and tries to commit suicide by hanging off the edge of the deck until she was rescued by Jack. Jack is then invited by Caledon to a dinner amongst the rich in return for his heroic action. He goes through the evening acting his best at being rich. Jack then takes Rose down to the third-classe's party, where they dance endlessly. Shockingly, one of CaLedon's spies had followed them and informed him of his fiance's sneaking around. Rose was intruiged by Jack's drawings and so she asks him to draw her nude wearing the diamond necklace Caledon gave her. Caledon finds out and had plotted against Jack, he falsely accussed him of theft and had him locked away. Not long after, the ship encounters an iceberg which threatens to wreck it apart. Panic overflows the ship as the crew/staff takes safety precautions, giving people life vests. Soon, the lower parts of the ship begin to drown. Jack is in danger and so Rose is in panic to rescue him from the room in which he is in chains in. She manages to get an axe and breaks the chains. The water was almost head-level. They both swim upwards and get to the top of the ship. Boats were getting filled up, women and children going first. Caledon ushers Rose to go in, promising her that Jack was going to be safe. She doesn't believe him and returns back for Jack. Caledon, furious, chases after Jack and Rose with a gun in his hand. Fortunately all his shots miss and they manage to escape to the top of the ship. Caledon soon fakes having a child in order to board a boat. At this point, the Titanic's end was titing upwards at an extreme angles, people were falling off whilst others were lucky enough to clang onto stuff. Jack and Rose hold on to the top of the ship and get ready to dive into the deep, freezing water. Fortunately, Rose;s life vest allowed her to swim a bit more easily, can not say the same for Jck though. Rose clings onto a wooden boards whilst Jack is barely holds on to it. They pass out and by the time help comes, it was way too late... Jack had frozen to death. Unknowing of that fact, Rose tries to shake him awake until she comes into the shocking realization. Jack drops t the deep ocean, his corpse becoming a part of the ocean. She is then rescued by the crew and taken back. All the survivors from the Titanic are saved by the RMS Carpathia.",10/10
Bravo,stormhawk2021,20 June 2017,"Titanic is a movie I've seen countless times since I was a little kid and it came out. This movie is one that seems to polarize people to extremes. Some love it and will call it one of the best movies they've seen and others will hate it and label it one of the worst. As far as where I stand on it today, I still believe it is a very good film that benefits from marvelous special effects. Jack wins his way onto the Titanic in a poker game and runs into first class rich girl, Rose, when she is hanging off the end of the ship, apparently about to commit suicide. Jack saves her and they start spending a lot of time together, which really pisses off Rose's rich, but unpleasant fianc√©, Cal Hockley. The story is told by the 102 year old Rose, as treasure seeker Brock Lovett searches for a diamond that was given to Rose by Cal on the boat. The movie has its share of problems. The dialogue, at times, can be corny, as can the actions. The acting, while serviceable most of the time, has some terrible moments, especially from Billy Zane and Bill Paxton. Also, the film suffers slightly from its long run time. It's not something that bothers me a great deal, but had the film been cut by something like 20 or 30 minutes, it would have flowed a lot better. Titanic isn't James Cameron's best film, but it is a majestic and epic one. I like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose, and I also really liked Kathy Bates as a first class passenger that has just come into her money. This isn't one of the best films ever, but it's, at times, fun, sad, infuriating, and joyful. There's an emotional roller-coaster going on here.",10/10
Phenomenal movie even if you don't like romance,popyoshi-36312,5 March 2023,"I wasn't really looking forward to this film, its a 3 hour romance movie and I am not a big fan of romance, but I gave this a chance and I have to say this is genuinely one of the best films I've ever seen. The movie manages to focus on a relationship between 2 different classes while also keeping it interesting with mystery, an intensity of what might happen, dread for the inevitable ending and also make many other characters interesting in there own right. The romance is done in a very realistic way and because of all the reasons I mentioned, the naturalistic acting of the actors and just how fun most of the characters are to watch on screen the movie really works. They also show the present and while I personally think that's the weakest part of the movie it does supply some interesting plot points and make the film more enjoyable overall as you're not constantly stuck in the past, the ending is also given a much more satisfying conclusion due to the present time scenes. Finally the 3rd act of the movie where the ship comes to its end is done in a brutal way showing just how much ruffles death it caused, how desperate the people where and how sad it was. The movie doesn't pull a punch and due to its long run time you almost feel like you know what it'd be like and almost like you yourself where there. Honestly I massively recommend giving this movie a change 10/10.",10/10
A Master Classic!!!,li0904426,31 August 2022,"""Titanic"" is a masterpiece in every single angle: beautiful plot, amazing direction, stupendous visual effects, perfect cinematography, outstanding soundtrack, and breathtaking performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. This is a typical Hollywood movie but on a grand scale. ""Titanic"" will be known as the ""Gone with Wind"" of the 90s. James Cameron with his vision created a classic. He involves us from the beginning of the film, with real scenes of the wreckage of the Titanic in the present day. From there, he takes us back to the past and introduces each character in his opera. For more than three and half hours, we are embraced by the love story between Jack and Rose and also by the tragic event in every single details.",10/10
"Come on, admit it. This is a great film!",TOMASBBloodhound,19 April 2003,"When you have a film this big and successful, it just stands to reason that a number of people are going to try to bash it. Especially when it happens to be a romance. And sure enough, I am the only male I know who has anything positive at all to say about it. Is all of the criticism warranted? Let's see...Jim Cameron didn't need to create this huge-scale, heavily detailed historical drama to prove to me he was a great director. This film did pretty much convince the rest of the movie-going world, though. We all know the story of this great luxury liner sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on that chilly April evening in 1912. The substantial loss of life still ranks among the great human tragedies of recent history (9/11, Pearl Harbor, etc). Cameron spared no cost of either time or money to make the ship and its furnishings look exactly as they would have on that maiden voyage. In terms of technical detail, this film is without peer.
The cast is generally appealing. Leo DiCaprio is far from a world-class actor, but his enthusiastic and earnest portrayal of Jack Dawson couldn't have been done better. Kate Winslet looks right in her element as a pampered young debutant trying to brake away from her boring life consisting of endless dinners and tea parties. Kathy Bates as ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" is always likeable and the rest of the cast (mostly Brits) does a good job of filling out their respective roles of cast and crew. Billy Zane gives the film's best performance as Winslet's greedy, snobbish fiancee. He is one of our most underrated actors. And you have to love David Warner as his bodyguard/enforcer.   As far as the special effects go, it's hard to imagine the sinking of the ship could have been filmed any better. Each time you view it, you seem to get a different perspective of just how lucky any of those passengers were to survive not only the actual sinking, but waiting around in life boats for help to arrive. As of this writing, only three known survivors are still alive. One can only imagine how many countless hours it took to conceive of, shoot, and edit the last hour of the film. The results are terrific.There are flaws in the overall mix, however. Some of the dialogue (Mostly Leo's) is down right corny. ""When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose!"" or ""You seem like kind of an indoor girl"" are two examples. Also, the notion that a guy from steerage class could go up and mingle with the first class passengers under any circumstances is not plausable. Keep in mind that a first class ticket on Titanic in today's economy would go for $80,000! These were some RICH people, and they wouldn't have let a guy like Dawson near them.Anyone who watches this film will have to endure numerous scenes of sappy romance. This film is a romance above all else. Just tough it out if it bothers you. It's not that bad.This film is tragic, exciting, sensual, pretentious, corny, extravagant, and even a little cheesy. And I love EVERY DAMN MINUTE OF IT!!!!!!!!5 of 5 stars.So sayeth the Hound.",10/10
PLEASE SEE THIS IN 3D!!,teomslaer,12 February 2023,"I don't know why I have waited so long to see this but I finally got to see this in theaters during the 3D rerelease and oh how I messed up. This was the best 3D film I've seen as well as a top 5 movie of all time in my opinion. It has everything, romance, humor, terror, drama, and not too mention, one of the best ""historical"" movies out there. This also was the first time I cried during a movie, and I've seen too many to count. Someone may want to take my man card but I don't care. If this doesn't move you, you might need to get your pulse checked. Just an amazing movie. If you can see this in 3D, DO IT! It's worth the money and the slightly higher frame count is a really nice touch! It adds a little smoothness without the soap opera effect which can turn some people off. Cant wait for this to come out on 4K blu-ray! NEVER LET GO!!",10/10
"If this movie is ""over-hyped"" we only have the public to blame....",crystalc1020,20 June 2003,"I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it.  I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do!  I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. As for those that think that this film is ""overrated"" or ""over-hyped""...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol*  You see, it's not CRITICS/article writers that make a film ""HUGE"" or a ""HIT"" with the general movie-going public.  PEOPLE make the film a huge success.  With Titanic, everyone was in awe.  Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before.  At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!  Give this movie a break you guys!  The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time!  When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more!  So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was ""overhyped""...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being ""overhyped"".  ha!  Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film.  However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more!  Personally, I LOVE this film.  However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though!  THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it!  The story was sweet.  The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship!    I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job.  It's not thier best work (I've seen much BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn't the WORST I've seen on screen before. Give them a break!",10/10
Breathtaking recreation of the tragic voyage,blanche-2,5 September 2010,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are young lovers on the doomed ""Titanic"" in this 1997 film directed, written, and edited by James Cameron. The film also stars Billy Zane, Gloria Stuart, Kathy Bates, Francis Fisher, and Victor Garber.Rather than go into the story, I'll just say that this film is a true masterpiece, meticulously researched, designed, costumed, and acted, and gives one the feeling of the desperation, fear, sorrow, and finality that the people on the ship must have felt. The entire time I watched it, I kept thinking of the people on the planes and in the World Trade Center on 9/11.There have been several films about the Titanic but none so lovingly recreated and so powerful emotionally. Kate Winslet is exquisite as Rose, the upper class young woman engaged to a brute (Zane), who falls in love with third class passenger Jack Dawson (DiCaprio). DiCaprio is terrific - exuberant, passionate, and adventurous.If you don't know a lot about the Titanic, this movie will pique your interest. When you read more about it, you'll be impressed by Cameron's commitment to bring this piece of history to life.",10/10

Ultra-Hollywood Spin on one of the 20th Century's Most Famous Disasters,Twillhead,10 June 1999,"Being of a rather sensitive nature, I steered clear of ""Titanic"", mostly because I did not want to witness the deaths of the 1500+ people who perished in the icy Atlantic waters in 1912. Thus I only recently saw the film on video, months after all the hype, the awards, and subsequent hoopla had played itself out. ""Titanic"" is certainly a lush, beautifully photographed and well-mounted film, although it is almost a bit too ""slick"" for my tastes. I thought Leo and Kate were blandly likable, but I was not very much interested in their characters or their performances. The supporting cast, however, was top-notch, in particular Frances Fisher's remarkably restrained performance as Rose's mother. Ms. Fisher did more acting with a 3-second, tight-lipped glance of disapproval then Leo did with 3 hours worth of stilted dialogue. And Billy Zane managed to twist his classically handsome features into an oily, and sometimes frightening, visage of callow shallowness. The wonderful Kathy Bates always lends a touch of class to whatever role she undertakes, and as Molly Brown she doesn't disappoint. I would have been much more interested in the plot if the story had been told from Molly's perspective rather than Rose's. But the real point of the film is the tragedy itself, which is depicted with harrowing, overwhelming clarity during the sinking sequence. On this level, I think the film is fully realized; however, the fictitious story line is seriously flawed, and I have a difficult time believing Leo as a romantic leading man. In ""Titanic"" he's more like the arrogant kid who should be taken to the woodshed and spanked.",8/10
One Of Cinema's Greatest Triumphs,CinemaClown,8 August 2023,"Winner of 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, the highest-grossing motion picture of its time and a cultural phenomenon that possibly has no equals, Titanic is an extraordinary feat of blockbuster filmmaking that presents its gifted filmmaker at the apex of his craft as he offers a spectacle of such breathtaking cinematic ingenuity & profound emotional depth that it can still rival & demolish most tentpole releases of today on most fronts without breaking a sweat.Written & directed by James Cameron, the story takes a simple premise of two star-crossed lovers from different social classes who fall in love on the maiden voyage of the ill-fated vessel. It is a safe narrative framework to apply amid the backdrop of a tragedy but it is carried out with such warmth, grace & sincerity that we are fully immersed & invested in the unfolding love story and are already on-board when the inevitable happens and turns the sweet, tender romance into a tense, thrilling ride.Despite the story marking a radical departure for Cameron when compared to his earlier efforts, he steers the production ship with sophistication and directs each scene with unfailing authority to deliver the desired goods. James Horner's exquisite & evocative score is as essential to the viewing experience, for it elevates & enriches the journey by an enormous magnitude. And it doesn't end there, for the performances are just as brilliant, with Leonardo DiCaprio & Kate Winslet leading from the front with an infectious chemistry that just works.Overall, Titanic is an immaculately crafted & flawlessly executed Hollywood epic that blends old-school melodrama with astounding visuals to deliver a grand, memorable & powerfully affecting experience. Establishing James Cameron as the one artist you never bet against, catapulting its leads into overnight stardom and still retaining every bit of its magic, appeal & emotional impact after all these years, Titanic is one of the greatest achievements of its medium and is a romantic saga for the ages that engulfed & enraptured a whole generation unlike anything before or since.",No Rating

Timeless and epic masterpiece,nirome,22 March 2019,"On a purely technical level, Titanic was considered at the time the crowning achievement of a filmmaker who's always strived to top his last cinematographic entry with the next. Up until that point and still to this day, he's managed to do just that. He's always made the most of the technological advantages at the time and always come up with a jaw-dropping, mesmerizing visual spectacle. Even at times when budget constraints and uncooperative technical crew, due in part for his apparent lack of experience and fresh off- the- boat from his first serious outing on the directorial chair for The Terminator, like it was the case in Aliens, he's always managed to deliver. It sure does take him a long time to come up with the next one, but everytime he does, he hits the box office's bullseye.
This time around and, with one of the more simplistic storylines ever put to the big screen, he brings us one of the most memorable and fondly remembered movies of the late 90s.
From the very first shot of the movie, those sepia color-corrected images that convey a haunting feeling of remembrance and loss, to the first images of the research vessel subs exploring the entrails of the haunted ship, we plunge right into what it must have felt like walking onto the deck of the Titanic. And we go back to the plot. As I said before, using the simplest of plot devices, a , on the other hand, very well told love story with tinges of social clashing, we are treated to a 3 hour, eye - catching spectacle that moves along at a whip-like pace. With very strong performances all throughout, gorgeous cinematography and production design, state-of-the-art visual and practical effects and a perfect score by the great late James Horner, this is probably one of Cameron's best efforts behind the camera and a movie for the ages. Needless to say, the strongest asset of the movie is its third and final act, with the depiction of the sinking of the titular ship and the resulting mayhem. That, as always, and with the character development groundwork previously laid out by Cameron, is the main reason to watch this movie, and why the audience is so invested in what's happening onscreen. As I said, great movie and larger-than-life characters to go with it.",10/10
"When the boat sinks, this film starts to rise",cricketbat,5 July 2023,"Since I was a teenager in 1997, I can say with some degree of confidence that Titanic was made for teenage girls. Almost all of my female friends of the time adored this movie and paid to see it multiple times in theaters, so I can see why it saw so much box office success. Also, there's no question that when the boat sinks, it's terrifyingly spectacular. However, the real downfall of this movie is the terribly corny dialogue. The script sounds like it was written by adolescents. Plus, the love story is overly melodramatic. I can see why Titanic made a splash, but I only really enjoy the last half.",7/10
25 Years On & Still A Classic!,vengeance20,10 February 2023,"Saw this on DVD with my family at a young age but only remember bits & pieces of it. Fast forward to 2012, & I saw this yet again, on the big screen for the 100th Anniversary of the actual ships sinking & found it to be great. I saw this again for the actual films 25th anniversary & found it even more great than before having not seen it in years.The film sees a young man, Jack Dawson, an artist who boards the Titanic along with 17 year old, Rose, who is set to be married, but falls in with Jack. However, the ship in which they board hits an ice berg & it is then they find themselves along with the other 2198 passengers stranded in the middle of the Atlantic.I found the film to be great. It's very well written & directed with my only complaint being that it's too long & drags quite a bit at 3 hours & 7 minutes. The drama & romance are great as with the action parts we see involving the lateral half of the film which does keep you glued as the 2 main leads try to survive & stick together through carnage that unfolds.As I said, the film did hold your interest but was too long & dragged at points, when the action does kick in, you are sat there wondering what will happen, even if you have seen 1000 times. There's some eye candy with Kate Winslet & we see Leonardo Di Caprio in his early days of acting, both actors do well with their parts as do the others. But the film could've been sped up at points & edited to be below 3 hours at least by 30-45 minutes.Overall, it's a great film. It's sad, intense & has some funny moments for the 3 hours & 7 minutes it runs. However, despite the action, eye candy & drama, the film is too long & drawn out & could've been shorten down by 30-45 minutes & sped up in areas. But it's a great film if you haven't seen it yet, I myself have seen it about a couple of times & can say now I've seen it twice in Cinemas on the big screen. It's a still an overall classic film 25 years on since it's 1998 release.8/10.",8/10

This movie is so hard for me,Tarpsi,18 February 2023,"First time i saw this movie was when i was 8, with my mother in the theater.Next time it was with my stepfather, my brother and my mother when i was 15 and in that time i knew more about the life so i cried.Third time was with my ex girlfriend 8 years ago.Today this movie hit me harder then any time before. When i was a kid a whole life was in front of me and much more people around me. There was an idea and hope that i will find a perfect love one day. There was an idea that you could become Rose or Jack one day and make things right. And this movie being very powerful it makes you remember very good the moments when you watched it in the past, how you felt, how people around you felt. Today, idea of finding the perfect love, like the one from this movie is idea of a missed opportunity, or the lack of luck. Is idea that triggers the nostalgia and not promises for the future.The big love that could happen.In some amount there is some Rose or Jack in everyone of us. Or there will be.",10/10
A masterful tale of love and tragedy in one of the best Hollywood productions,Elvis-Del-Valle,21 March 2023,"Titanic is one of the best films both by James Cameron and in history in general for obvious reasons.

It has many things going for it: an excellent script, very good production, excellent costume design, great cast with good performances, a beautiful soundtrack by James Hornet and Celine Dion, good direction, good special effects and the list can go on and on.

"Excellent, epic drama",Rob_Taylor,28 June 2003,"There is no doubt that James Cameron is capable of putting out fantastic cinema. The man just seems to have a feel for what will pull on the emotions and his eye for scene setting has no equal. Some spoilers ahead.I recently re-watched this on video, on a small TV, and it still blew me away. Action fans will, of course, be disappointed. Perhaps this even qualifies as a chick-flick. I don't know, and don't care. It's just a great movie and never drags even at over three hours.I've tried hard to find niggles, to be impartial, but the only things I can point to are a couple of instances where the special effects were bad (at the beginning, where the bow of the sunken Titanic looks exactly like what it is....a model) and later where Jack and Rose are on the the foredeck and the camera is looking back toward the superstructure (where the scenery looks like the backdrop from a school play). Other than these, the story and effects are fantastic and enhance the film rather than overpowering it.I always cry at the end, with the old lady's scenes of returning to the ship. This is one of a very few movies that do make me cry. For that reason it will always be a favourite.",10/10
THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD,jeromesgabilo,21 September 2023,"Classic. Timeless. Perfect love story. These words are usually used to rate this James Cameron film, and they are appropriate. I felt like if this was released this year or any other years, this would be the same award-winning classic as it is. The progression of scenes, from the exciting opening to the chaotic last half of the movie, everything was in perfectly done. Its visual effects were ahead of its time as well. Leonardo DiCaprio's and Kate Winslet's portrayal of this lovely couple was the best in the history of on-screen love teams. Neither was greater of the other. They complemented really well.",9/10
The Huge Machine,tedg,20 May 2003,"Spoilers herein.I admit to a certain admiration of Cameron. Alone among special effects manipulators, he has a solid sense of what works cinematically. When he invests, he invests in a world. That world envelops us with its completeness and magnitude. It is the opposite of, say, Carpenter, who invests in the stage, in the world of the performer rather than the viewer.As far back as `Aliens' this talent has been apparent. This time, he sticks to the formula of a simple story annotated by all sorts of associations. No second plotline. No ambiguities or any questions open for viewer judgment. But he is sensitive to this I think and that is why he chose the most promising young actors that know something about narrative folding. That's where you act both in the space of the story and the world of the viewer. Kate in `Creatures' and Leo in `Romeo' did this. Kate has since grown to master it. His intent is underscored by making the color of her hair more brilliant. I don't know why yet, but this seems to signal such acting, at least in women.But alas, except for the brief scene where Leo draws her - a natural situation for this type of acting - it is absent. Probably Cameron intended something deeper and more nuanced but just couldn't manage it. In this case as well as that of the ship, the vast machine wins.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",No Rating
Unforgettable motion picture,851222,8 July 2013,"Greetings from Lithuania.I'm a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countless documentaries about the tragedy. I'm a movie buff as well - and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work. This is a storytelling it's at is best. Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx ""movies"" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them. Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this.",10/10
Dramatic and Heartbreaking...,KFstudios2009,12 July 2023,"Titanic, is a movie about love, the dramatic Titanic sink, difference between the rich and the poor and how people are only thinking about themselves. The movie is perfect in any way, including the acting, action, plot, camera-filming and much, much more. This is the first time I am watching Titanic, and I am impressed that this movie was better than I expected. In this movie, the rich and the poor people, for different reasons, are traveling from England to New York with Titanic. This is also based on true story, by the way. They are showing the romance of a rich girl and a poor boy, that they are loving each other, but it is difficult when the two stages of richdom are combining each other. When the catastrophe begins, you can see how the rich people only cared about themselves, not the others. The characters where played very well, including Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) it was a fantastic duo in this movie, and the rest of the characters where also played well and they made a great expression. James Cameron is making most of his movies great, very long movies usually, but he is still using the time well and not wasting it like some directors like to do. I think that it make sense that this movie have got so many Oscars and I recommend this movie for everyone.",10/10
Cameron masterfully balances moments of levity and tenderness,disharma-24131,11 July 2023,"Titanic"" is a visual spectacle that showcases James Cameron's mastery of filmmaking. The attention to detail in recreating the ship is truly remarkable, immersing viewers in the lavishness of the first-class accommodations and the stark contrast with the cramped conditions of the lower decks. The cinematography captures the grand scale of the vessel, from the awe-inspiring shots of the ship sailing across the vast ocean to the tense and heart-wrenching moments as it meets its tragic fate.The performances in ""Titanic"" are exceptional, with Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio delivering powerful and heartfelt portrayals of their characters. Winslet brings depth and complexity to Rose, portraying her as a young woman torn between societal expectations and her desire for true love and freedom. DiCaprio's Jack exudes charm, warmth, and an infectious joie de vivre that perfectly complements Rose's character. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable and adds an extra layer of authenticity to their on-screen romance.The film takes viewers on a rollercoaster of feelings, from the exhilaration of young love and the joyous moments of freedom aboard the ship to the heart-wrenching tragedy that unfolds during its fateful encounter with an iceberg. Cameron masterfully balances moments of levity and tenderness with scenes of intense drama and despair, making the emotional impact all the more profound.In addition to its compelling narrative and stunning visuals, ""Titanic"" also boasts a memorable and haunting musical score composed by James Horner. The iconic theme song, ""My Heart Will Go On"" performed by Celine Dion, became synonymous with the film and further elevated its impact on popular culture.If there's one criticism to be made about ""Titanic,"" it's that the film's runtime of over three hours may be a bit daunting for some viewers. However, the story is so engrossing, and the pacing so well-crafted, that it rarely feels like a burden.In conclusion, ""Titanic"" is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences worldwide. It combines a poignant love story with breathtaking visuals and a profound exploration of human resilience and the fragility of life. James Cameron's direction, coupled with outstanding performances and a captivating soundtrack, cements the film's place in the annals of cinema history. Whether you're a fan of romance, drama, or historical films, ""Titanic"" is a must-watch that will leave an indelible mark on your cinematic journey.",10/10
I thought it was a cheesy romantic movie but it's one of the best movies I've ever seen,helen_may,3 July 2023,"So I saw it as a child. And I didn't feel anything about it back then. Yes, a tragedy. Yes, a romantic story. But it all seemed to be pretty simple.I rewatched it multiple times as an adult. And I cried every time.First, yes, it's a romantic story and a tragedy. But it's not a common one. Because Rose and Jack are not as toxic as romantic couples usually are. And their love story has its reasons.Rose wants to get out of her life when she boards the ship. She is annoyed by her mother, she hates her groom, and she is a free soul from the very beginning.Jack is also free. He is an embodiment of freedom.So it makes a lot of sense that they fall in love.Their relationships evolve as the tragedy happens. Because Rose understands that she wants to be with him (= to be free) and she fights for it. She had a chance to run away but she didn't.And when the whole thing with the ship happens we see how tough and brave they both actually are. How much they want to survive.In a way, the movie ends with Rose getting her freedom. She is a changed person, she follows her dreams and Jack gave it to her in a way.Every shot of the movie is a masterpiece. The ship's orchestra moment, the old couple, the mother and her kids will probably haunt me forever.The movie is truly a masterpiece and I love it.",10/10
"To be fair, when Jack tried to get on the door, it tipped up.",BA_Harrison,15 January 2020,"A big boat hits a huge lump of ice and slowly sinks. Meanwhile, a chirpy American lad, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), gets it on with Rose (Kate Winslet), a posh bit of British totty, much to the annoyance of the girl's fianc√©, Cal (Billy Zane, putting in a wonderfully loathsome performance).James Cameron's Titanic is what I call 'factasy'. In other words, it's a factual story combined with fantastical elements to make the finished article more entertaining to the masses. A more recent example of this melding of truth and fiction is The Aeronauts, but where that film played it too fast and loose with the facts and ultimately came crashing down to earth in tatters, Cameron gets the balance of real and imagined just right, making his film both a fascinating insight into one of the most famous disasters of the 20th century, and a thoroughly charming love story.A master storyteller, Cameron successfully steers his way around any potentially disastrous obstacles that threaten to bring the film to a standstill. Even though there's a good hour and a half before any sight of an iceberg, Titanic is thoroughly engrossing from start to finish, a testament to its director's skill at weaving a good yarn, and to the talent of his impressive cast (which includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy). Kate and Leo make for one of cinema's most iconic pair of lovers, and exude a likability and charm that carries the first half of the film. The latter part is mostly about the special effects, something that Cameron excels at, always pushing the boundaries of technology. Even after 23 years, the sinking of the mighty ship is a sight to behold, and still sends chills up the spine.It's only the film's closing moments that prevent me from giving the film full marks: why oh why did Old Rose (Gloria Stuart) chuck her priceless necklace into the sea? Give it to your granddaughter, donate it to an orphanage, put it in a museum, let Bill Paxton have it, but please don't throw it overboard! And as if that crazy act wasn't reprehensible enough, when the old dear carks it, her spirit returns to the Titanic to be reunited with Jack -- excuse me Rose, but what about your dead husband and father to your child?9/10.",9/10
How many times I watch this movie.... It's still the masterpiece.,TaylorYee94,2 September 2020,"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",10/10
STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),BJG-Reviews,10 March 2021,"The stage curtains open ...Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by ""Titanic"". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again.",10/10
"Despite a lot of plot flaws and conveniences, this really is one of the best films ever made.",paulclaassen,3 July 2018,"Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word!",10/10
Great,MrHeraclius,23 February 2020,Very beautiful and cinematic movie with lots of classic scenes.Also extremely sad at times.Absolute 90's classic.,No Rating
Actually it got better for me,Smells_Like_Cheese,10 August 2001,"Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her controlling fianc√©, Cal Hockley and her desperate for money mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a first-class formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing, music and beer in third-class. After revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks, they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together.So does Titanic live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and Leo Mania was born at the time. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but please don't let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. It has great acting, amazing effects, beautiful costumes, outstanding sets, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. Otherwise I don't think we'd still be talking about it so many years later. Kate and Leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. Despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot, I think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. James Cameron, the extreme perfectionist that he is, went over time and money budgets for Titanic, but this was his baby and it paid off very well. James had captured everything about Titanic and the sinking so well. He respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn't just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. He had every right in my opinion to scream ""I'm king of the world!"" at the Oscars, because this movie blew everyone out of the water(no pun intended), you know what? I'm going to admit it, I love Titanic, even past my teen years I absolutely adore this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too since I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. Remember one thing, be true to yourself, don't follow the crowd, lovers or haters, if you go with the hype you're always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it, then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. I do recommend Titanic, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.10/10",10/10
This was one of the few movies that actually brought me to tears.,rtivey913,5 December 2014,"Good Lord. This movie right here, it's a masterpiece. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watched this. I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it would probably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" and the end when all those perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack. This movie was absolutely amazing and I would watch it over and over again.",10/10

Timeless,Kingslaay,12 May 2017,"Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this.

As perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get,InaneSwine,18 February 2016,"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.",10/10
One of a Kind,Boyo-2,11 December 1998,"To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it?

I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book.  It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted.  I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that?

Astounding as this may sound, I've just now got around to watching ""Titanic,"" 23 years on, and I'm staggered at all that I've missed my whole life.Young love is the most wonderful theme to explore in a movie, but it's also the most difficult to depict beautifully and without too much cloying treacle.

A Superb Epic,sddavis63,16 November 2002,"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see."" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost ""you are there"" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect ""t"" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of ""My Heart Goes On.""Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.9/10.",9/10
My review is this film's 2400th....so what more can I say?!,planktonrules,30 March 2013,"""Titanic"" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron's other huge success, ""Avatar"". Well worth seeing once.",9/10

Every time I see this movie....,acdc_mp3,23 January 2022,"I wake up in the middle of the night with total anxiety.While the fictional story line is fairly cliche and some of the characters are a little cringe (Bill Paxton's hair and earring, for example), the truth is this: 1,517 people died horrible deaths in the icy Atlantic in the dead of night. That eats at me constantly. I think of some of them being all cozy in their beds, happily dreaming of going to America, and suddenly they are waken by the rumbling of the iceberg hit, by the alarms, by the sounds of rising panic and the unbelievably coldness of the weather and water. It saddens me to this day.I caught the movie yet again while channel surfing and sure enough, I stopped and ended up watching the last 90 minutes. The recreation of the sinking is amazing and horrifying. The details presented put you right there. I always put myself in that situation mentally and I wonder what would have become of me. No one can truly know until it actually happens. I think about the cold more than anything. I have been in very cold places before, but never getting soaking wet in that cold. The people who ended up alive in the water went through a horrible hell for a few minutes then hypothermia drifted them off to their deaths. It's haunting to think about. I woke up around 3am after having a dream I was in icy water, trying to catch my breath, trying to stay afloat, and not doing very well at either. The anxiety level increased as I began to wake up and I got mad at myself for watching the movie right before going to bed!My thoughts go out to those souls who perished on the Titanic and I hope beyond hope that there is a better place they went to.",10/10
"Amazing in 1997, 2005, 2015, 2030, 3010 & forever more a Masterpiece!",katherinegranada995,20 January 2015,"You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding! Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",10/10
"In retrospect, we were all too hard on this film",felgo,30 January 2023,"If you're a Millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'Titanic-mania' during your childhood, where everyone was obsessed with this movie. It was in theatres for almost a year, and every girl between 8-20 was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. Despite winning numerous Oscars, Titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men.In hindsight, if you had your image of Titanic shaped by the negative media landscape surrounding it in the late 90s to the 2000s, I highly suggest you give it another go. It really is a wonderful film, and it's enjoyable and fun even if you're a guy. The special effects are second to none, the acting is great and James Horner's soundtrack is absolutely majestic. Even the love story itself, while a bit gushy in parts, is actually quite sweet and endearing. Both Rose and Jack are full realized, strong characters who you care about.My advice, especially to 20-30 something year old men who were told all their life that 'Titanic sucks', is to give it a chance. You're sleeping on not only a great drama, but a great action movie as well.",9/10
Titanic masterpiece: an emotional and visual thrill ride,otr91,31 August 2015,"Titanic is one of my all time favourite films. I'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the First Officer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. The violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. And the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right at the end when you see the photos of Rose's life, knowing she's fulfilled her promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having met anyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago.Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, great acting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic, enduring film. A romantic-drama unlike any other. It deserves higher than 7.7.",10/10
"One of many movies and many stories from the ship of dreams, but still floats at the top of the list.",mark.waltz,30 June 2020,"From ""Cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""Titanic"" in 1953, ""A Night to Remember"" in 1957 and ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" in 1964, the doom ship Titanic became a voyage of legendary, if tragic, proportions, and in the time leading up to its 85th year spawned a TV movie, a Broadway musical and this masterpiece which had audiences preparing to get tickets for it even before it was finished shooting. The reason is clear: James Cameron, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, the promise of effects like you'd never seen in any movie, and a Celine Dion song sung over the teaser trailer that would shoot her to super-stardom.This is told in flashback through the experiences of the 102 year old survivor Rose Calvert (veteran 1930's movie actress Gloria Stuart, nearly forgotten until cast in this), shocked to see a drawing of herself in pristine condition. The nude drawing of her as a young woman wearing a valuable diamond is found in a safe pulled from the ancient wreckage and she immediately notifies the explorers who are searching for more Titanic artifacts and stories. Arriving with pretty much every single belonging of hers as well as her doting granddaughter, Stuart winces in tears with a sudden memory, but insists on going on with her story.From there, we are swept back decades to the luxurious ship on its maiden and only voyage, and the huge vessel is grandly detailed and scaled as only an epic of this nature can scale it to be. Winslet is engaged to the vain Billy Zane, forced by her desperate mother (Frances Fisher) to tolerate him because they are broke and only have their ""name"" to benefit them. Fisher, obviously having married ""up"" , is ultra snobby to the neuvo riche Kathy Bates, and when she meets Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), she knows trouble lies ahead, and her demeanor is enough iceberg for any young lady. Dawson has saved young Roe from committing suicide in the icy waters below, and their first encounter turns into a love that you know can only end tragically.With real life Titanic passengers Brown, John Jacob Astor and his wife Madeline (which would be a great subject for a separate movie), Benjamin Guggenheim and Isadore and Ida Strauss (another subject that would be a touching film), this mixes in these real life characters with the fictional ones. Zane and his humorless right hand man (David Warner) are great villains, with Zane absolutely vile as he psychotically tries to maintain his stolen dignity when he loses his trophy wife to be to a commoner. Watching Zane go psychotic as he stoops to the depths of evil makes you wish he wouldn't make it off, but the writers have an even better plan for him.The film takes well over 90 minutes before the disaster sequences start, and from then on, it is a dizzying, sometimes headache inducing bit of tense moments as DiCaprio, locked to a metal pole to drowned for daring to love Winslet, struggles to be set free. It goes on a bit too long, but for first time viewers is truly frightening. There were buckets of tears being flowed at the Paramount Studios theater I saw this in prior to the release, and even after half a dozen or so viewings, it can still bring them on.Certainly this is filled with cliches, but they are the type of cliches that have worked since the days of the silent movies. This was probably the first film since ""Gone With the Wind"" to be considered a guaranteed Oscar winner, sweeping a good majority of them when it came out. In many ways,, this has very old fashioned ideals and is thus an old fashioned style movie, one of the last of its kind that still worked (""The Artist"" from 20 years later was a rare exception.) I can watch this once a year and still be emotionally turned to mush by it. That is what makes an instant classic.",10/10
This Film Brought Me To Tears,lilbuch22,12 September 2019,"I am still crying as I am writing this review as of right now. I don't even know where to begin. I can now see why this film was one of the highest grossing movies of all time. The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred. James Cameron you are and will always be one of the best filmmakers to ever live and this is your ultimate masterpiece.",10/10

the ultimate lovestory,ops-52535,27 June 2019,"Titanic is the film ive viewed 2nd most of all, i am the kinda guy that can watche a good movie once every 2 to 3 months, and ive seen titanic some 25-30 times and i should know the storyline pretty well.when seeing this in the theater first time alone and the next night with my wife i was lost for words each time. my wife cried the whole night and well into the next night of this lovestory, and whenever i put this in the video, i know ill have the tv space for myself, cause she made a promise to never ever let herself into a mental state again as when watching it the first time.its not so much the act that does this film, its far too cliched' to become a marvel of acting, but its the heart and the cruelty of life and death that crushes my heart each time i see it. the last 15 minutes are the worst, and i usually stop when the flag goes below the surface of the ocean..the grumpy old man might be a cry-baby, but its worth it, the second highest on my ever best movie list",10/10
"Haunting, Powerfully Resonant And Visually Stunning",CalRhys,11 January 2015,"James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version. Nonetheless, 'Titanic' is a modern classic and a beautifully spectacular film that will live on.",No Rating

Triumph in Tradgedy: Titanic,ssoracoe,23 February 2001,"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the Titanic's legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 11:39, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanic's many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanic's officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaire's Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-English speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss'.  Not wanting to leave her husband's side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr. Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the Post-Victorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to `new money' such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives.  Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night.  In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.
Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic.  Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.  If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.",9/10

We see it in the opening shots of ""Titanic,"" encrusted with the silt of 85 years; a remote-controlled TV camera snakes its way inside, down corridors and through doorways, showing us staterooms built for millionaires and inherited by crustaceans. I can all say I'm not much into a romantic films cause they'll sucks, and this movie isn't like that at all. I can clearly say it's the best romantic film ever made till the day.

Still Holds Up After 15 Years,Michael_Elliott,14 April 2012,"Titanic (1997) **** (out of 4) James Cameron's Oscar-winning love story about star crossed lovers (Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet) who come from different back grounds but fall in love aboard the Titanic. I remember seeing this on its opening weekend and it's amazing to see how well the film holds up after all these years. Yes, since it became so popular there are always going to be those who hold that against the film and while it's far from a masterpiece I do think it holds up quite nicely against many of the classic epics that have been made since D.W. Griffith's THE BIRTH OF A NATION. That film, GONE WITH THE WIND, BEN HUR and other epics were all grand on scale, told big stories with big effects and each of them had flaws here and there.The most amazing thing about TITANIC is the way Cameron is able to tell the fake story and mix it in with so many real-life people and events. Since 1997 I've watched countless documentaries on the real subject and watching the film on its re-release made me appreciate it so much more. The little details given about certain real-life people was a major plus and so were the smaller touches. The amount of love and detail that Cameron puts into every single shot of the movie makes it very poetic and at any time you can't help but just look around and try to take in everything in the frame. Very few films have gone all-in with their subject matters but this here goes for everything and just comes up short at a few times. It certainly helps that you have two strong leads turning in fine performance.Winslet was clearly the best of the bunch as she brings so much life to her character and perfectly manages to fit every side of her. Be it the rich, spoiled girl, the confused one, the heroic side or the love story aspect. I was less than thrilled with DiCaprio when I first saw the movie but looking back on the movie he too really stands out and delivers. Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart also deliver.I think the biggest flaws in the film can be had in the screenplay. Many people objected to having the fake characters so close to the real ones during the finale but this here didn't bother me too much as when we see the real people it's in situations based on what we're led to believe happened. What bothered me in 1997 and today is that Cameron decided to make Zane the main villain over the iceberg. I really think the story starts of go overboard during the third act as Leo gets chained up and then we have more drama wrapped around the real event. There's no question that the romance made this movie such a hit but I think it could have worked with everyone had the stuff with Zane been toned down. God knows there was enough drama with the sinking to make up for Zane running around with a gun. With that said, that's about the only problem with TITANIC and those things aren't disastrous enough to ruin the movie. There's no question that the romance works, the special effects are terrific and on the whole this is just a movie that works on every level.",No Rating
Maytime On The High Seas,bkoganbing,2 September 2007,"Who says that old fashioned romantic films don't sell. They certainly do if they're done right as the story in Titanic certainly is.This blockbuster version of the most famous shipwreck in history is a homage to Maytime. In fact in casting Gloria Stuart as old Rose through whose eyes we see the disaster unfold, Director James Cameron went back to a contemporary of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.The film begins with the discovery of the wreck of the Titanic in the middle Eighties which did cause great excitement at the time. Searching the wreck divers come upon a safe and a nude portrait of a woman wearing a necklace with a diamond thought to be lost and the portrait is dated April 14, 1912. The woman is still alive and its Gloria Stuart who tells her tale the way an aged Jeanette MacDonald did in Maytime.Winning a card game that got him a third class passage aboard the maiden voyage of Titanic, itinerant artist Leonardo DiCaprio gets on board the vessel. He meets and woos a younger version of Gloria Stuart who is played by Kate Winslet. Unfortunately she's about to enter a loveless marriage for money urged on by her mother, Frances Fisher, who wants her declining years not be spent in the poorhouse. Her prospective fianc√© is Billy Zane a rather arrogant young robber baron heir of his time who has a factotum/bodyguard in David Warner who has one of the best roles in the film. Still Leo and Kate get a few stolen hours of romance before the disaster strikes.One thing that James Cameron did is that he never allowed the spectacle of the disaster nor even the issues of wealth and class that were omnipresent in the Titanic story to overwhelm his romantic leads. In fact they are an integral part of the story as young Leo reaches for what was unobtainable.Leonardo DiCaprio remarked that his part of Jack was the least complex role he ever did. The part is a romantic lead, the guy has no secrets or hidden issues, he's just a young man in love. Maybe that was the reason he was not nominated for Best Actor in the face of all those nominations Titanic did get. It won for Best Picture and Best Director and a flock of Oscars in the technical area. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart were nominated and lost for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively.Titanic is a story that's been filmed since the silent days almost in the wake of the disaster itself. The Germans made a propaganda film of it in 1943 which Nazi inspired though it was, did make a few points against the British upper classes and that the first class got saved and those in steerage mostly drowned. There was a fine version in 1953 with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck as an older married couple with problems on the doomed ship. And the British did the classic, A Night to Remember which is a documentary like recreation from the ship's officers point of view.Still they'll have to go some beat this one. Titanic is a film for lovers of all ages and run Maytime back to back with Titanic if you can get DVDs and/or VHSs of both films.",10/10

Titanic for the romance.,saeedahmedsasoli,18 November 2020,"So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred.So as much as our culture remembers Titanic for the romance, fittingly the deepest theme of this movie about so many tragic deaths is finding the will to live. In order for Rose to recapture her will to live, she needs to honestly face what's wrong in her life and cut that out. Committing to being alive means committing to living authentically as oneself.",10/10
Titanic - 11/10,pukingtorture,23 June 2022,No spoilers! - Titanicdefinitely one of my favourite films ever. Its so beautifully made and i love it so much!Would recommend and would watch again!,10/10
Will never let go..,edit-53160,15 March 2023,"For me this movie has the same power as music. That chapter in your life that you remember where you were when it came out, and the memories that come with it. For me Titanic is an experience not just a movie. The fact that the sinking is real gives it that next level of visceral emotion. I never forget that the sinking of Titanic is real, but the gloves come off once we see the captain prepare to go down with the ship. All hell really breaks loose at that point and that's when I'm truly reminded how horrific that must have been, even if you were a survivor. I'll be the first to say that James Cameron seems like a real d***, but I appreciate his genius and I'm grateful for this amazing film! Don't get me started on the beautiful, haunting soundtrack, now THAT is visceral!",10/10
25th Anniversary Review,alex-mott,13 February 2023,"There are two love stories in this film: the first Romeo and Juliet and the second James Cameron and the ship. Every millisecond is thought through, nothing is compromised and the attention to detail is extraordinary. The holes for each rivet in the hull of the 1/20th model were drilled by hand and actors who actually resembled the 1st Class passengers aboard ate and drank using teacups and cutlery stamped with the White Star Line emblem. The production is a seamless mix of miniatures, practical effects, CGI and actual footage from the wreck site and also genius in terms of saving money if you investigate further. There's nothing wrong with Leonardo DiCaprio's performance but Kate Winslet shines and, combined with the backstory of the search for the necklace, Titanic as a whole is an entertaining and respectful blend of fact and fiction, very well paced and doesn't feel like a 3 hour film. I'm a Titanic buff, so biased - the final few minutes of the ship tearing in two with hundreds of people still clinging to the stern makes me wince every time - but James Cameron's version of the disaster genuinely ticks every box. It's not only the most accurate account of the sinking ever committed to screen, but is still and will probably remain one of the best films ever made.",9/10

Stood the test of time.,lixiang7349,24 June 2023,"RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster. Titanic was under the command of Captain Edward Smith, who went down with the ship. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada.The first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a gymnasium, swimming pool, smoking rooms, high-class restaurants and cafes, a Turkish bath and hundreds of opulent cabins. A high-powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger ""marconigrams"" and for the ship's operational use. Titanic had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, contributing to its reputation as ""unsinkable"".",10/10

"Stunning, powerful, and magnificent, in every way",I_Ailurophile,3 August 2023,"Even if one missed the proverbial boat when it first launched, and sits to watch this titan very belatedly, it's nonetheless all but impossible to do so without full awareness. The movie holds a place in culture for which there are dashingly few points of comparison: the real-life history, the production history, every last facet of the movie itself, the reactions, awards, jokes, memes, parodies, and so on. Even still, on all accounts - its place in culture, its place in cinema, its accolades and acclaim, and not least on its own merits - there comes a time where it behooves one to watch 'Titanic' for ourselves. Over twenty-six years my expectations have ranged from mixed to high, but I have to say, this really does make a huge impression, right from the start, and proves itself all throughout its substantial length. For all that could be said of this film, and has been in the past two and a half decades, it really is a terrific modern classic, well deserving of its great esteem.There are many flavors throughout these 190 minutes, some coming off better than others. One could remark on how the tale of the RMS Titanic and its fate is romanticized, or how heavy-handed it approaches concurrent themes - all too relevant to real life, contemporary and modern - of classism, deep-seated sexism, and the outright subjugation of women; haughtiness, pride, hubris, jealousy, selfishness, toxic masculinity; the vapidness of wealth and society versus the vitality of the working masses, and more. Some lines and scenes are entirely too on the nose, especially but not exclusively where they concern the ultimate doom of the vessel or those failures and oversights that contributed to the catastrophe; some moments are decidedly ham-handed, embracing kitsch; at some points I'm surprised by how much prominence is given to the present-day framing device. Any scenes that diverge even slightly from either the central romance, or the looming disaster, sometimes feel marginally extraneous, even including the framing and Hockley's abject villainy; at the same time, the swiftness and intensity of Jack and Rose's romance is a bit much at times.And yet for any nits that one may reasonably pick, there's also this: James Cameron penned an absolutely extraordinary screenplay. There's unexpected balance among all the varied parts: the thrills and much needed spark that Jack brings to Rose's life; the love and warmth of the all too brief love affair; joyful humor, shrewd wit, and sheer fun; the cold, hateful antagonism of Rose's fiance and his lackey; the magnitude and gravity of the accident, the protracted sinking, and the excruciatingly tragic loss of life; the reminiscence that frames the core tale. Every beat of the narrative, and every component part that's woven in, is written with wonderful sagacity, and a mind for delicacy, tact, and nuance. Every character and line of dialogue (even those of a less pristine flavor as noted), and more importantly every scene, is written with fantastic intelligence to ensure every moment carries with it the utmost possible vibrancy and impact. Truly, the screenplay is exceptionally smart and well-rounded - and Cameron's direction is at least as grand, shaping every passing minute with an exquisite eye for detail. The result of all this isn't just a historical drama, or a love story - it's a disaster flick, but in contrast with the effects-laden extravaganzas that mostly just revel in destruction, this is one in which we're made to earnestly feel each and every dire moment, and the urgent human cost of such terrible events. For that, 'Titanic' might actually be the best disaster film we've ever been given.But by Jove, this is barely scraping the surface of everything that makes this such a tremendous, enduring picture. There are more familiar, recognizable names and faces in the cast than it even seems at first blush, and while Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio get all the focus, this is to say nothing of Billy Zane, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bill Paxton, David Warner, Kathy Bates, Bernard Hill, Eric Braeden, Ioan Gruffudd, and still more. Everyone - sincerely, everyone - gives marvelous performances that very ably capture every mood, from the lightest to the darkest. Nevertheless, the actors may rather be outshone by the utterly outstanding contributions of everyone working behind the scenes. The feature represented a famously enormous production - replicas, models, sets, stunts, and practical effects all as huge as the ship itself - and every last trace simply looks incredible. I dare say the crew are the real stars, for the immensity of every last piece is just plain dazzling; it can't be understated what a magnificent job they all pulled together. I understand that there are some disputes as to the total historical accuracy of the costume design, yet even at that there can be no arguing that Deborah Lynn Scott assembled sartorial arrangements that are to die for; not to be counted out, the hair and makeup is lovely. Russell Carpenter's cinematography is stupendously rich, not to mention amazingly dynamic, crisp, vivid, and smooth, frankly rivaling Cameron's direction in its brilliance. Editing, sound, sound effects; even the post-production CGI is astoundingly keen, to be honest more seamless and realistic than even that of many titles that have followed in the years since. And what can one say of the music except for how perfect it is? Late great composer extraordinaire James Horner remains higher in my esteem than no few of his fellows in the industry, and the score he put together for 'Titanic' is super. Much of it works around the theme song that all know so well, ""My heart will go on,"" to gratifying success, but even setting that aside there are more odds and ends here that have worked their way into the public imagination than I first realized. Horner's music is unquestionably one of the endless highlights of so stellar a movie - and for as much as Celine Dion's rendition of ""My heart will go on"" has become a meme unto itself, it still stands as a beautiful, emotional song that holds definite power.For those various flavors that the writing boasts, some better than others, and for all those ways that the narrative may be stronger or weaker in select times, I quite think these are the only points of criticism of any real significance to be drawn. I'm hard-pressed to think of anything else that sticks out as a flaw, even noting how Cameron's magnum opus takes some liberties with historical record. Moreover, whatever notes one might make of ways in which the whole may be less than perfect: I sat to watch with expectations that ranged from mixed to high, and I'm completely blown away. This is even better than I could have hoped. I'm of the opinion that if this 1997 feature is less than perfect, it's a difference of tiny fractions, and not whole numbers. Part of me is stunned, and part of me is a sobbing mess, but in no part am I inclined to think of 'Titanic' as anything less than a gem - a finely cut diamond, if you will. To some degree I can't believe what I've missed out on for so long, though on the other hand, I don't think I'd have been able to appreciate this twenty-six years ago as much as I do now. When all is said and done I have nothing but praise to offer: this is a heartwarming, heartbreaking, powerful, staggering work of cinema, in every capacity, and it has fully earned all the lofty regard lavished upon it. 'Titanic' is, truly, a phenomenal film. Bravo!",10/10
The Greatest Motion Picture of all time..??,emm,31 January 1999,"So you flip through the cable channels on your remote. The same old music videos are running, and the reruns get tiring. Later, you find something interesting. The evening news, Entertainment Tonight, 60 Minutes, VH1, and every other network airs clips from this, the biggest money-making film in history. TITANIC emerges as a genuine Hollywood classic for the second generation of American cinema. Never since GONE WITH THE WIND has there been powerful moviemaking with heavy genius from James Cameron. It's more than just a love story. It's an all-out disaster movie with style and vigor combined with a creative instrumental music score. It even began the craze that lured us into discoveries of the gigantic ship that never proved itself when it sunk anyway.Brilliant use of photography is what stands out the best. Imagine every single little piece of detail that wouldn't fit on this message. Replicas of the engine room and the interior designs are highly crafted to maximize the full experience of being on the Titanic while sailing on crisp, clear sea water filled with dolphins swimming with grace. During the night, one can look up the starry skies while the bright lights shine. How tragic it is for a luxury liner to capsize in half, sinking miles beneath the surface, and showing off the greatest achievement in motion picture special effects! A job extremely well done! Who will match this kind of excellence in the near future?As for the players, the pair of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are now remembered as the Clark Gable & Vivian Leigh of the next generation. Both are young, of course, and they really can ACT! Winslet should have taken home the Oscar (what blasphemy of those Academy Awards judges!). Her performance as ""Rose"" is a show stealer, as she did most of the incredible acting far better than today's young actresses. From smoking a cigarette, to possessing true beauty, to posing nude, to being a heroine, and to become a survivor, this will be a role so hard to beat in Winslet's future films. DiCaprio, on the other hand, also does magnificent as a ""street boy"" and a ""troublemaker"". The second half is the most important time to discover his best talents, including the end. Both are sensational in almost every respect.Well, you can't always expect a movie to be perfect. TITANIC's shortcomings are relatively minor. The ""modernized"" scenes don't quite prove true to a historical masterpiece made with expensive sets and decorations. Mr. Jerry Garcia Lookalike should've changed his shirt, instead of wearing the one with ""Happy Face"" shot in the head. But Gloria Stuart as the old ""Ross"" makes up for the modern touch in telling and revisiting the Titanic story through her past experiences. It's also important that we already know how the disaster had become, and that the movie tells under a fictional basis.Of localized interest: Diana Morgan was once a TV news anchor for an NBC station out here. She has recently taken on an acting career playing the role of a news reporter, notably in BABYLON 5. You will hardly get to notice her on that small TV set shown at the start of the film, but you can hear her voice.Over three hours of powerful and unprecedented movie imagery. To date, it may very well be the greatest film ever made.",9/10

"25 years Later its still the only movie to win 11 oscars and be the number one watched, loved and remembered movie of all time",GusherPop,20 December 2022,"In the opening sequence of Titanic, a group of treasure hunters send a robotic probe far beneath the ocean's surface in search of treasures (and one particularly precious jewel) still tucked aboard the titular sunken ship. The camera attached to the probe reveals a vessel that's certainly rotted but still carries hints of its prior glory. The explorers coo and sigh as they see what's been waiting a century for them, as if they're looking at their dreams made manifest. This is the day they've fantasized about, and the treasures of people who once lived and loved aboard the RMS Titanic are their bounty. When the film was released, it was a gamble the size of ... well, the metaphors present themselves a bit too easily. It was a wild risk, both for filmmaker James Cameron (who was known for Aliens and his Terminator movies) and for the studios that funded it, Paramount and 20th Century Fox. Cameron's terrible temper and a runaway production with troubles to spare - one disgruntled crew member laced the chowder at craft services with PCP one night, provoking hallucinations in 50 people, including cast member Bill Paxton - had prompted people to wonder if the legendarily expensive film was doomed for the same fate as its subject. The production budget reportedly ran over $200 million, an enormous sum by any contemporary standards that was much more so in 1997. Titanic remained No. 1 at the North American box office for 15 weeks in a row. It was nominated for 14 Oscars and won 11 of them, including Best Picture. The movie continued playing in theaters for nearly an entire year, and didn't close until October 1, 1998, after earning $600 million in North America and twice that worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until 2010, when Cameron's Avatar wrested away the title. Titanic is two movies stitched together: a swoony teenage fantasy for the ages, and a massive disaster movie that rivals any disaster movie to come out of Hollywood either before or since. The lengthy runtime makes perfect sense by this rubric, and you can see the seam where the movie pivots from one to the other, almost exactly at the halfway mark. That Titanic is two movies in one is part of its genius: If it were just the romance, it might have been written off as a ""movie for girls,"" but then there's this whole other disaster element too. From a marketing perspective, that's gold.",10/10

Romance and tragedy conveyed masterfully,habib_khodadad,29 June 2018,"James Cameron's masterpiece, Titanic, is incontrovertibly the greatest anecdotal tale ever to grace the film industry. This movie has to be Cameron's masterpiece that has never been rivalled in its grandeur. This movie has a phenomenon ability to connect the audience on an emotional level, taking them on an emotional rollercoaster as the characters form bonds and face adversity from all flanks of life. This story juxtaposes the idea of love and power in different shades and angles. Leo and Kate have a relationship that is based on human emotions and desires for bonding, while Zane challenges that connection of human connection by flaunting his wealth and attempting to allure Kate with his affluence. This creates tension between the characters, and the story is very effective at controlling the crescendo so that the audience has an opportunity to connect emotionally with the characters that face this adversity. With Zane always prowling about throughout the movie, trying to win over Kate's heart with his money, there seems to always be a sombre feeling looming in the background as the events unfold between the main characters. This ominous sense of dread that is always suspended in the atmosphere seems to tie in well with the fact that the entire Titanic, the biggest commercial ship in the world, is also portend to face an unknown tragedy in the future. The director effectively seems to symbolize that human love between Kate and Leo as the impervious Titanic ship itself, and reveals the vulnerable side of it. This poetic depiction is demonstrated with so much gusto and romance, that one cannot help but fall in love as the inevitable tragedy dismantles that colossal giant known as love present in all human beings.",10/10
A masterpiece that gets better as I age,vandykeu,8 July 2022,"Titanic is a film I wish I had seen in a theater because of its epic scope. Unfortunately, I was a young, dumb teenage boy in 1997, and the movie was premised to me by all the other young, dumb teenage boys as a chick flick. Worse, everyone knows the ending! Ah, to be young, stupid, and crass.Now, at 40, having lived some of life and experienced love and loss, I can think of few films that do a better job of capturing the joy of the former, and the pain of the latter. The titanic itself is merely the stage of the story, and while James Cameron's portrayal of it is expertly done, it is the story here that really shines. Like much of Cameron's work, there is little that is truly original about the story- it is a pretty standard tale of lost love, with themes that echo to all such stories through history. However, what Cameron, Di Caprio, and most of all Winslet pull off here, is marvelous in its execution.Watching this in 2022, I marveled at two things that feel most poignant now. First, this is a deeply feeling film, which clashes strongly with today's cynicism. Indeed, cynicism here is almost the main villain (alongside hubris and classism, of course). Rose is trapped in a world of cynicism, and Jack rescues her from it and helps her to reconnect with her true self. It's beautiful to watch, and the payoff is Rose's story afterward. Even Brock, who is only searching for the titanic in order to find the jewels and become rich, is turned away from cynicism by this story.Second is the protrayal of what I will call 'enthusiastic consent'. In today's world of MeToo and No means No, a distressing number of movies portray acts of love from a predatory male perspective. These portrayals reinforce bad male behaviours, and make it especially difficult for young inexperienced men to act appropriately and recognize a woman's degree of interest in them. The relationship Rose and Jack share, by contrast, does an admirable job of displaying enthusiastic consent. Jack is patient, understanding, empathetic, and above all a very good listener. He makes the first moves of the relationship, but does so gently, without expectation (in stark contrast to Billy Zane's character). Rose then initiates all of the more physical/sexual interactions. There is never any confusion about intent, because their communication, both verbal and otherwise, is so good. It is incredibly sensual. Likewise, there is never any real conflict between Jack and Rose, and the one instance it is tried to (clumsily) be inserted with the accusation of theft, Rose dismisses it rapidly. A lesser film would include some sort of conflict to cause 'drama' between the leads, but Titanic does not. This is a model of what a healthy relationship should look like, and I find it refreshing in this day and age.",10/10
"Happy 25th Anniversary, Titanic...You Made It Count",JohnnyRatesALot,17 August 2023,"Titanic (1997) is my #1 favorite film of all time and I'm so glad James Cameron re-released this masterpiece worldwide for its 25th anniversary, introducing it to the new younger generations.Went to see it with my girlfriend for Valentine's Day weekend, in 4K 3D, and it was absolutely phenomenal. Experiencing it on the big screen gave the film an epic, larger-than-life feel. Watching Titanic with an audience also amplified the emotions and people cried so much. Including us. It was a very surreal night.Titanic is a masterpiece on so many levels. The soundtrack alone is still one of the most haunting, beautiful tracks ever created (Rest In Peace James Horner). You can tell Cameron put his entire heart and soul into the creation of this film, as well as the main characters Jack and Rose. Speaking of Jack and Rose, I want others to know why they're such an important element to the story. Their characters are truly vital and necessary in order for the audience to feel the tragedy of Titanic's sinking on a deep, meaningful level. If I may explain:We know Jack and Rose were fictional. But very important to leave a lasting impression. While we wish they could've lived ""happily ever after"", Jack's death was necessary for a very crucial reason. As time goes on, Titanic's disaster becomes a long distance in history, detached from the actual trauma of the event. We can look back at the reports of the sinking, and all the deaths, and realize how horrible it must have been: but it's still just numbers to us. By the time the film came out, Titanic had been at the bottom of the ocean for 80+ years already. Very few survivors were left alive, and for most people, several generations separated them from the wreck.I think having Jack, the charming co-lead of the movie die, after we spent so much time getting attached to not only his character, but also his growing relationship with Rose, was meant to be the emotional *punch* necessary to make the disaster feel real to us in the modern world. Seeing their adventures aboard the ship, going on this journey with them, you really began to root for the couple. If it were any other movie, they likely would have gotten their happy ending. But Cameron wanted us to feel the loss - even a little bit - that the survivors and families of those lost aboard the ship felt, by taking this character away from us, just inches from the finish line. In that way, Jack is meant to be a stand-in for everyone who lost their lives that night.Those are my sincere thoughts. Kate Winslet and Leoardo DiCaprio both gave brilliant, phenomenal, and dedicated performances with their characters. No one else could've done a more perfect job. Their onscreen romance works so well because of the wonderful chemistry they share. Kate was the perfect embodiment of an Edwardian society girl; she was only 21-years-old at the time but had the mentality of a mature woman twice her age. Leo and his character felt much wiser and ambitious beyond his years, as well.The ending is possibly the most beautiful, unforgettable endings to a movie ever. It just numbs you with chills and unlocks so many emotions. No matter how many times I watch Titanic, I become immersed into the film and emotionally invested in the tragic history. This movie, winner of 11 Academy Awards, is a piece of history itself.Titanic is a timeless classic that never fails to pull at our heartstrings and remind us of a real life tragedy; a horrific disaster that took the lives of 1,500+ people in a single night. Cameron did a brilliant job at conveying the heart of this tragedy through masterful filmmaking and storytelling. A film that I'll never let go of.Easily a 10/10!",10/10
Holds up better than its namesake,Mike_Devine,25 June 2023,"It's fair to say that 'Titanic' has forever earned its place in cinematic history. From its gripping, timeless subject matter to its decade-plus run as the highest-grossing film of all time, the James Cameron behemoth as indelibly left a mark on pop culture.Thanks to a gargantuan budget (the only way Cameron knows how to make a movie), the nearly four-hour blockbuster is part love story, part disaster flick. The film is carefully crafted through the narration of centenarian Rose (played beautifully by Gloria Stuart), which breaks up the flow from just a straight shot run through the many times told tale of the ship's doomed maiden voyage across the North Atlantic. But of course, the stars of the show are a young Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, as the two rode the wave of the success from this film to accelerate their already bright careers.The reason 'Titanic' works is because it's the perfect mix of drama, romance, action, suspense and history. It's not about telling a new story; it's about telling an old story through new perspectives. The recurring theme of societal status is full on display and harkens back to a timeless struggle. There's also the amazing special effects and CGI, which at the time were world class, and of course James Horner's unforgettable soundtrack (alongside the overplayed power ballad from Celine Dion).'Titanic' has been parodied to death over the years, but it still remains one of the best cinematic stories told in the past few decades.",8/10

Titanic--Disaster of Dreams,forrestwrs,29 May 2007,"There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film. Let's just face it, though, the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I'm saying they stunk in this film. The special effects were decent (and I will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye-pleasing), but IT even has several major flaws. For instance, right before the ship goes under, you can see an unfinished blue-screen image behind your main characters.Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the story of the REAL Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to that story. Editing was atrocious--there's no reason for any film to be over 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of MAYBE a biographical movie), and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted.I will say that the music was perhaps better than I could have predicted (and not just the ""My Heart Will Go On"" song either). There is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard. That could very well be the highlight of the film. As for the mood throughout, it was extremely dull. I was more relieved than sad when Jack died, which I know cannot be what the director intended.In a nut shell, I find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the Titanic into an over-hyped chick flick.",8/10
Titanic in 4K is breathtaking after 25 years,gabethedinosaur,12 February 2023,Titanic looked so beautiful and awesome in 4K 3D . James Cameron should have thought about remastered 4k since 1997 25 years since I was a little toddler when I watched it on vhs üìº. The 3D effects and sound was so outstanding. I hope they release it on 4k disc and I'll add it to my Disney blu ray collection. 3D 4k is the number one best remastered. I hope titanic fans see this movie before Valentine's Day . And James Cameron if your seeing my review you deserve an Oscar again for releasing titanic and making 3D 4k a hit.I'll never let go titanic I'll keep her in my dvd blu Ray collection forever.,10/10
Hands down and quite possibly the best live action movie of all time for me,lisafordeay,15 May 2013,"Well what can I say you gotta love a good disaster movie set on real events and Titanic checks ALL the boxes for a good movie. Set in April 1916 the movie opens with an elderly woman named Rose(played by the late Gracie Stuart)who talks to the reporters(one played by Bill Paxton from Mighty Joe Young) and she talks to them along with her granddaughter about the story of the Titanic. So we cut in to see all the people being sent aboard the famous ship and we see a younger looking Rose(played by Kate Winslet who looks so different with her dyed red hair)and her boorish fianc√©e played by Billy Zane(from The Phantom)who is by her side as she sets sail on the ship. Meanwhile a charming man named Jack Dawson(played by the gorgeous Leonardo Di Caprio before he morphed into Eric Dane's love child now)as he and his mates are playing cards so his friend decides to abort the ship with him as he yells the famous line IM THE KING OF THE WORLD.But later in the film Jack falls in love with Rose while his staying on the ship and the two become really close with each other. But what will Rose's boorish egotistical fianc√©e think of it??.This film maybe 3 hrs long but its definitely worth it. The music by John Horner is brilliant there's this one scene I can recall where Jack and Rose are dancing to some Irish music and they had a lot to drink and their smiling and laughing at each other,THAT was just so well done. Also you gotta love the Celine Dion hit My Heart Will Go On.The story is brilliant in fact this is what REALLY happened on the Titanic and if you come across another movie that says Titanic: The Legend Goes On I suggest you avoid this one and watch this overrated flick instead of it as the animated version well if you seen it you know what its like.Also I loved the chemistry between Winslet & DiCaprio which was so realistic and genuine. Bottom line if you haven't seen it then check it out im telling you,that you won't regret it. I seen it a million times before and if I catch it again on TV at an earlier time than i'll watch it again.10/10",10/10
Absolutely beautiful movie. A Cameron masterpiece.,archer191273,28 January 2019,"This story follows Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio). A poor artist who wins his ticket onboard the Titanic in a card game who meets Rose (Kate Winslet). A beautiful young woman who is raised in an uppercrust society who sees her life as too predictable and in control by her pompous buffoon fiamce Cal (Billy Zane) and craves a life of somewhat uncertainty. When Rose meets Jack an unlikely romance blossoms as the Titanic embarks on it's ill fated maiden voyage.
Cameron truly put in a lot of hard work to create an absolute masterpiece here. Yes the movie has flaws but what movie doesn't? I love how he made what could of been a dreary and gloomy drag of a movie and turned it into quite an up beat story (up until Titanic strikes the ice berg). This is in my favourites. And ignites a fascination for the tragic story that is the Titanic. So sad and outrageous how mostly third class passengers died in this disaster.",10/10
Watched loads of time's before,MattHankinson,12 October 2020,"I was watching football on my Sky go and titanic was on in the background.

Best movie ever,esjacobs,12 July 2022,"I was 13 when this movie came out, remembering how impressed I was back then and still love it this day. I rewatch it every other year or so, and still get the chills, the movie stays the same but every time I watch it, I notice something different. One big thing I notice is how incredibly well it's been done (especially for back in the day) the work that went into it making it so realistic. Great chemistry between Leo & Kate, especially Kate caried this roll so well. It hits me right in my feels, and I love it when a movie does that. Now that I'm 37 and seen a lot between 1997 and now, I can definitely say Titanic is my number 1 movie of all time.",10/10
Lies & Annoying Romance Ruined Story,ccthemovieman-1,30 August 2006,"No sense going into great detail about this film, which just about everyone who watches movies saw when it came out. I still don't recall a film getting as much ""hype"" as this one did. I doubt if the Second Coming would get the kind of publicity this movie received. It was disgusting - the PR, the story and the favorable box office response.Oh, once the ocean-liner hits the icebergs and the disaster starts, it's terrific but that's not until the last 45 minutes of this 194-minute movie. Too bad we had to wade through all the baloney before this climactic scene.The baloney, in a nutshell, was (1) a stupid teen romance between two arrogant, unlikeable people; (2) most the film being a lie, defaming many of the people who were heroes in that disaster, instead choosing to picture them as selfish villains.The latter is all in the name of 'political correctness,' some filmmakers like James Cameron, are filled with, something akin to horse manure.To make it brief: in real life, the men in the First Class did everything they could to get the women and children safely off the boat. Just look it up! Relatives of those people were justifiably extremely upset over Cameron's totally-fabricated story, and I can't blame them.Anyway, even with all the untruths, if they had cut down on the Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet rebel-type attitude and romance, it would have been a far better film, but then again you wouldn't have the billions of dollars in revenue from the 12-15-year-old girls who flocked by the millions to see this farce. The rest of us would have preferred to see the true story of the famous disaster.",5/10

Still stands out as the GREATEST film ever made.,cyndymarks,11 April 2010,"Thirteen years after Titanic launched and all it takes is the first few bars of that haunting music to transport me back to my first time watching the movie in the theater. It was beyond comprehension - the entire spectacle and production. I bought the books, read the history books and found myself immersed in all things Titanic.I didn't hurt that my great, great aunt was on the ship and survived. It makes it a little personal for me. In fact, I happen to own one of the only objects in existence that came off of the ship into a lifeboat and did not go into the water.Love the movie - it still is #1 in my book.",10/10
Crass In The Extreme,screenman,12 December 2008,"First; let me say that the recreation of the RMS Titanic as a computer- generated entity is extremely well realised. If ever we needed proof that CGI can add an extra dimension to established technique and 'effects' when it's done with meticulous precision - here it is.But what about story? The Titanic contained over 1,500 human stories. Most of them were to end in terror on that fatal, freezing night.However, Mr Cameron decided that non of these were worth spit. They would serve simply as a desperate backdrop for two imaginary characters who might just as easily have been computer-generated themselves, so artificial, clich√©d and crass were their presentation.Star-crossed young lovers projected against conflicting circumstances of the larger world have been a staple in human drama for as long as we have kept records. Perhaps the most famous example is Shakespeare's 'Romeo & Juliet'.What have we got here? Disaffected society girl meets, and finds redemption, in gallant working-class hero. Pass me the vomitarium, someone. She already has a beau; and he's as knavish as can be. In an early silent movie you can see him with a big bristly moustache and cruel leer, tying his victim to a railroad track. He's not going to be put down by a working-class oik. He'll resort to murder, if needs be. Cameron turns this Mack Sennett clich√© on its head by casting the heroine as saviour. We see her wading waist-deep in the icy Atlantic waters without flinching from the cold (just you try it!), in earnest search for her manacled hero. Love isn't just blind - it's numb.But - hey; wait a minute! this is a romantic story from the old school. We can't let emancipation stand in the way of a damp hankie. The hero's got to do what a hero's got to do. Isn't that what males are bred for, after all? I mean; equality in pay is one thing, but equality in death? I don't think so. Oh-no; the male is always the more expendable. So, in the end we see him slowly freezing to death in the ocean whilst the heroine survives on a piece of flotsam. His duty done, his grip is relinquished, and he slips down to eternity. Whilst she gets to live another day and find a more durable schmuck. You can see that same scenario at the end of equally laughable 'Starship Troopers 2'. Yep; the hat's that old.And she might have to move pretty damn quick too. That passionate little dalliance in the coach could well have put a bun in the oven. It wouldn't do to have a child out of wedlock in 1912.Romance in the face of disaster became quite a fashion at this time, with other movies like 'Pearl Habour' playing much the same card. As I say; young romantic tragedy is a long-standing cultural staple in human story-telling. It just isn't usually so extremely crass and predictable as 'Titanic'.Tissues out or vomitarium at the ready, depending upon your gullibility quotient.",3/10
Timeless,moviesleuth2,6 January 2010,"It's bitterly ironic that the biggest blockbuster of all time is not on the IMDb's Top 250. Even stranger still, many who loved it at the time of its release have now turned on it (just ask anyone under the age of 25). This is not due to its quality, but to its hype. It goes without saying that a film this big had immense publicity at the time of its release, but what no one learned until too late is that there is too much of a good thing. People began to tire of hearing about what the stars (especially the new heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio) were doing, and they were sick of hearing gossip magazines never shutting up about ""Titanic."" The film had the odds against it: it's a romance, and that is one of the most volatile genres in terms of popularity. By the time the spoofs of the film's most famous scenes came along, ""Titanic's"" reputation was already in danger. After that, people began only to see the spoofs, and now the film's popularity has sunk to where the real ship is.I had fond memories of the film from when it was popular, so I decided to perform an experiment: even after the immense backlash the film suffered, could it still hold up? The answer is a resounding YES!""Titanic"" opens when a treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) finds a drawing of a woman wearing the diamond that he is looking for. Soon after releasing his findings, an elderly woman (Gloria Stuart) claims that it's her in the picture. So Lovett flies her out to his ship to tell her the story behind the diamond¬ÖAs a young woman, she was sailing to America to live the life of a boring society lady in a loveless marriage. Planning on ending it all, she is about to jump ship when she is saved by a young man from steerage. Thus begins a classic love story that is doomed from the start by complications other than those they began with.The reason the film is so good is because the two central characters are brilliantly written and acted. Leonardo DiCaprio became an instant heartthrob to girls around the world (something he apparently hated), and it's not hard to see why. DiCaprio has everything to make the male lead of an epic romance work: he's good-looking and talented (Winslet was honored with an Oscar nomination for her performance, although it's hard to understand why DiCaprio was left out, because he equals her). Jack Dawson is an immensely likable guy. He falls hard for Rose, someone who he knows is clearly out of his league. But he's so immensely likable that we want him to win Rose's heart. His new lover, Rose, is no ordinary society girl, much as she tries. She can't stand the rigidly controlled life she's going to lead, and Jack is her escape. But while she may wear a corset, she's no damsel in distress. She's independent and tough. The romance works because Jack and Rose are meant for each other.Their supporting cast is excellent. The two most important supporting characters are Rose's fianc√©e, Cal Hockley, and her mother, Ruth (Frances Fisher). Cal Hockley is a vicious snob with a constant sneer on his face. He comes from a wealthy family, and will do anything to get what he wants. He demands obedience from Rose, something she will not give (to anyone, much less Cal). Her mother, Ruth, is just as snobbish and cruel, but she's also desperate. Their family was left virtually penniless, and she's trying to save face. As cruel and despicable as they are, neither one becomes a caricature. Zane and Fisher should have dually been honored with awards for their acting. Bates is especially noteworthy as the delightfully brash ""new money"" Molly Brown.""Titanic"" was the most expensive film of the 20th century, and it's clear that every penny was put to good use. ""Epic"" doesn't begin to describe this movie. It's huge in spectacle, and the sinking of the ship, which takes up the last half hour, is jaw-dropping. But that's not the only place where the effects were used. We never get a sense that we're looking at sets or CGI; from every frame of the ship, we believe that we are on the ship with the characters. Interesting note: Cameron actually went down to the wreckage and filmed footage there. But that doesn't stop there. Cameron wrote a script that allows us to view every part of the ship (and in a way that's plausible.James Cameron has long been considered a god of action movies, but this is the first time his skills were honored. Not only is Cameron a wizard with special effects, he is also a master storyteller. ""Titanic"" is a long film (as all epics are), but not one of the 3+ hours of footage is wasted. The film moves, and there is never a dull spot. He knows the speed at which a person gets involved in the story, and uses this to his advantage. But the biggest accomplishment is that he makes the romance, one of the most difficult genres to dabble in, work with immense effectiveness. The romance burns up the screen, so much that we're more concerned with Jack and Rose's fates than we are taking in the sight of the sinking ship. And the scene where Jack draws Rose's picture is potently erotic (especially for a PG-13 movie, which shows not real nudity or sex, but it is strongly implied).I realize that I am not writing this to people who haven't seen the movie (are there such people?). I am writing it to those who are now convinced that this is a sappy and painfully bad film. I assure you: it's as good as it was the first time you saw it.",10/10
Your heart will go on. We get it. Stop cluttering my screen!,RiffRaffMcKinley,21 September 2007,"This movie is *pitiful.* It is *abominable*. In terms of dung heaps, it is second only to ""Superman Returns."" That's not a very honorable position.Why do I hate ""Titanic,"" you may be wondering? Here's a list. 1) Leonardo di Caprio's performance as the lovable but down-on-his-luck guy could have been played better and more realistically by Paris Hilton. 2) Kate Winslet's fake American accent is the least of the woes left by her whiny, I'm-a-poor-widdle-rich-girl turn. 3) James Cameron should automatically be disqualified as the director of any real historical tragedy, because he makes us care more about the prettiness of the ship than the victims. 4) Where James Horner's music fails to nauseate (he was really off his game here), you always have the classic fallback: Celine Dion's mess of a theme song.Those are the top four reasons-- I could write a 52-page essay on why this movie is so horrid, but IMDb doesn't provide reviewers with that kind of space, so I'll condense it a wee bit.If you want to watch a disaster, this film is perfect... and I'm referring to the debacle of the film, not the Titanic incident.",1/10

Titanic Review,EvanTheFilmFan1995,8 May 2023,"Reviewed on May 8, 2011.That's not all the movies I've watched today. After rewinding the Grease VHS and ejecting it out my VCR, I put in Titanic, and that was such a long movie. My parents also got this at Blockbuster back in 1998 as well. This is still an emotional movie. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's performances as Jack and Rose are outstanding, James Cameron's direction is great, the soundtrack is amazing (especially ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion), the special effects are well done, and the famous ""I'm the king of the world!"" line is so unforgettable.Titanic is such a masterpiece.

my heart will go on...,dbdumonteil,29 March 2003,"One of the monuments of the cinema which won 11 Oscars in Hollywood in 1998, a huge success (well deserved) all over the world. The revelation of two actors until then virtually unknown. This is James Cameron' masterpiece. He chose to relate the tragedy of the Titanic that took place on the 12th of April 1912, through the intermediary of a love story lived between a wealthy and pretty young woman (Kate Winslet) and a modest painter (L√©onardo Dicaprio). Cameron succeeds in making it fascinating in the first part of the movie. The love between ""Jack"" and ""Rose"" is so strong that can hardly believe the Titanic will bump into an iceberg and will sink. It's also together with a model bravery that the two lovers will try to escape the ship's sinking (although historically accurate).L√©onardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet will stay among the famous mythical couples in the cinema's history. It's obvious that they are between the hands of a conscientious and carefully organized film-maker. James Cameron doesn't leave anything high and dry. He adopted a sustained rhythm not spoiled by the enormous means that he's got. It's useless to say that he masters them perfectly thanks to an important budget. Not only has this budget enabled a meticulous reconstruction of the ship but it has also enabled a reconstruction from the traditional life in 1912 with its contrasts, its oppositions. Moreover, the movie enjoys an outstanding performance from all the actors, even the minor ones and several sequences and dialogs don't lack humor.But ""Titanic"" is also a limited place where takes place the confrontation of two different worlds: the proletarians and the middle-class persons. This confrontation is particularly well described during the ship's sinking: the rich are by the lifeboats whereas the poor are still inside the ship and they're forbidden to go outside.The second part of the movie is remarkably well filmed and follows a logical advance based on the increase of fear and distress. Cameron emphasizes particularly on the madness that spread to the passengers but also on the officers. Little by little, these last ones are becoming mad (one of them will kill unwittingly one of the passengers who was trying to get into a lifeboat). Besides, a few touches make the movie surrealist (the four musicians keep on playing while the ship's sinking)The other obvious qualities: a gorgeous music, some smart costumes. At the end, a movie that creates a deep emotion and where everything contributes to a perfect success.",10/10
Incredible epic,masonsaul,11 February 2023,"Titanic is an epic in every sense of the word, delivering everything from sweeping romance to horrifying spectacle, heartwarming moments of levity and heartbreaking drama. It's a James Cameron film through and through, especially with its fascination with water and it's all consuming nature.Kate Winslet gives an incredible lead performance, likeable, confident and full of warmth along with an instant chemistry with Leonardo DiCaprio who's instantly loveable with boundless energy. Billy Zane is so good, playing his utterly despicable character perfectly and Bill Paxton is one of the better self insert characters from a writer/director.James Cameron's direction is amazing, the film is meticulously crafted and the water based set pieces that dominate the third act are endlessly impressive and feel so real. The CG may be showing its age but it's still really impressive and blends with the practical elements rather well.The music by James Horner and the song by Celine Dion are both excellent, they works so well with the melodramatic romance due to the heavenly, emotional and awe inspiring nature that is instantly recognisable and deservedly iconic.",9/10
Best movie of all times,dreopdreef,21 May 2023,"I am writing this for those who have not seen it. Please give it a try, for this is the best movie ever made. The acting, the music, the decor, it is splendid.The first half of the movie is more about the romance and I had to get used to that the first time I saw it. The second half is very much about the sinking and if you are into spectacle, you are in for a treat.Regretably, Kate Winslet did not win the Oscar that year, but for me she is the absolute superstar of the movie. And ofcourse her career skyrocketed after this movie. She remains my favorite actress untill this day.So go see it!",10/10
So sad. So beautiful. Titanic is a brilliant movie of epic proportions.,TinyDanseur27,25 June 2013,"In honor of the 100 year anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, the movie Titanic was re-released in theaters, digitally remastered and in 3-D. Having seen the movie in theaters in 1998 when it came out, and loving it ever since, I was happy to go see it again in 2012. We owned the VHS when I was growing up so I've probably seen Titanic at least a dozen times. There's nothing quite like seeing it in theaters though. It's a film of epic proportions in both budget and content, and I think seeing it on the big screen does it incredible justice. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it there for the second time.I think many people criticize Titanic for the ""cheesy love story"". Jack and Rose are the early 1900's version of Romeo and Juliet, complete with a history that spans a mere few days, clashing backgrounds and of course Jack's death at the end of the movie. They even have some corny dialogue here and there (ex: ""I'll never let go Jack. I'll never let go.""). In spite of that however, I thoroughly enjoy their story. I feel that, unlike Romeo and Juliet, Jack and Rose's attraction to each other is genuine. She loves him because he pulls her out of her shell and shows her that there is more to life than money and social status. He loves her because she takes a chance on him despite societal expectations and loves him for who he truly is. I think it's great. Call me a romantic but I'm a sucker for their story. On a side note, it's so surreal to see Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet so young. They've certainly evolved as actors since Titanic.What James Cameron and his crew were able to do with special effects, construction and design in Titanic just floors me. Titanic is just so horrifyingly authentic. Every scream, every person crushed from a torrent of water, every piece of the ship ripped apart just looked so real to me. I think that's why I like it so much. I don't get my kicks from seeing people suffer, but there was something strangely beautiful in how that movie was shot and how the action of the ship sinking unfolds. I really felt like I was there with all those people. I really appreciated just how many different scenes there were. They made it a point to address many different parts of the ship, many different people and many different horrific ends. So sad. So beautiful. I hope that makes some sense.So now you know, I'm a sucker for Titanic. Guilty as charged.",10/10
Still works for me...,The_Core,26 March 2002,"Well, it's been a year since my last review of this film (this is review #3).  I saw ""Titanic"" on the big screen in 1997, and bought the DVD when it came out (which I still watch from time to time, maybe about twice/year).""Titanic"" still works for me as an epic spectacle and blockbuster.  The love story is OK, I don't really care... this is the movie to watch for eye candy and epic scope, not emotion.  I never did get caught up in any sobby or sentimental emotions with this film.  The overall story isn't bad... yes, some of the lines are cheesy and the dialog is corny, so what?  The low point of the film has to be DiCaprio sinking beneath the waves... not sad at all to me, but so what?""Titanic"" stands as a fabulous spectacle and a great movie watching experience.  The years have not diminished that in the least, and the special effects couldn't be done any better today than they were in 1997. The nit-pickers are still picking, 'sentimentalists' are still getting outraged at the 'realists' bashing the film, and I'm still sitting back and enjoying a couple times a year a film that was highly overrated at the Oscars (so what else is new) but where every penny of the budget shows on the screen... the spectacle of it... the scope, it can sweep you away.

"""Life's a gift""",Steffi_P,16 February 2012,"It's sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clich√©d and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status, but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet.Historical romantic epics like this have long been around, and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies. And yes, they may be formulaic, but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes. Titanic works by bringing us in, with those opening scenes, with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck, as we might have seen it in books or documentaries. The framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to. We are then gradually eased back into the past, and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her becomes humanized. And I'm not just referring to the central love story. In writing his screenplay, James Cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands, from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures. This broad, human retelling of a great disaster gives Titanic a wonderful richness, not to mention a deeper poignancy.Cameron was at this point best-known for his blockbusting actioners like Aliens and the Terminator movies, so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on Titanic. But Cameron was always a professional, never a show-off, and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity. He doesn't faff about with the camera, usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame. And of course, when the movie turns more action-orientated during the ship's sinking, his experience puts him in good stead. The collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that, every time I see it, I still hope the ship will turn in time. Throughout the movie there are a lot of point-of-view shots, more than most filmmakers dare to use these days, but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there. But perhaps Cameron's greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant, from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship, to Ismay's guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered down.The studio took a gamble in allowing Cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as Winslet and DiCaprio, but it paid off. Winslet is not a traditional beauty, but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable. At first glance DiCaprio seems to have been hired for his looks, but he proves to have a deep sincerity, such as the when he confronts Winslet and confesses his feelings towards her. And after all it's moments like this where a performance counts the most. But what really makes these two work is their believable youthfulness, and that eager rapport between them. Passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false, but Winslet and DiCaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair is irrelevant.This diamond of a movie is not, I'll admit, without a few flaws. Despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay, the dialogue is woefully trite. The special effects are typically over-ambitious '90s CGI, with texture-less surfaces and too many fake people (although to be fair it still looks better than, say, a scale-model would). But whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture, Titanic has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant. I hope cinematic history will judge Titanic well, because regardless of hype and counter-hype, it really is everything a movie should be.",10/10
Insultingly pretentious drivel,Horrorible_Horror_Films,23 May 2006,"Bloated neo-romantic crap are other fine discriptors of this movie. I honestly puke my guts out whenever the word titanic is mentioned. Hype, insulting plot, NON-Period sets, terrible lame dialogue, FAKE history all make this the worst blockbuster this side of phantom menace. Why do people like this movie so much? Really, pop-crap is what this is, nothing more. People proclaim James Cameron as some good director - this is the guy that directed ""Piranha Part Two: The Spawning"" for crying out loud! And if I see him on one more titanic type special I'm going to puke. Honestly, he already made a trillion dollars off of one shipwreck, can't he leave it alone already? Titanic sucks, OK?

A Hyped Misadventure,lediscipledessocrates,26 October 2014,"The movie in question revolves around the infamous shipwreck of 1912 where more than 1500 people lost their lives when the commuting leviathan sunk on its maiden voyage to the States. The movie made it big globally, had a great box office run and also managed to win a record of Academy Awards. The question, however, is ‚Äì was this movie really that good? In my opinion, Titanic, while not intrinsically bad, is an overrated cinematic venture. For a disaster movie it was too foppish and the treatment of a potentially rich subject matter, not exemplary . There was a visible disconnect between the storyline and the intended tone of the movie. Mr. Cameron, the director of the movie, is known for his sci-fi ventures, while the present movie required a far more realistic and even subdued treatment. Strangely, the movie devoted more screen time to the on screen romance of the two lead characters than it actually did to the eponymous vessel, which diverted attention from the focal event- the shipwreck. The director could have downplayed the romantic angle and instead given the audience a few moments of pensive repose to digest the enormity of the tragedy being depicted. Cinematizing real life tragedy is never easy, and requires a careful treatment of subject matter. Though undoubtedly a visual stunner, replete with amazing special effects, something the director excels in, the movie somehow could not achieve the same penetration when it came to dramatization. Titanic suffered from sufficient thematic and directorial inadequacies to warrant only moderate adulation and not the inordinate ovation it surprisingly received.",3/10
James Cameron's opus is sadly hit and miss,DavidSim240183,8 July 2007,"James Cameron's Titanic was nothing short of a phenomenon. Like so many others, I went to the pictures more than once to catch the must-see film of 1997. When I first saw Titanic, I was swept away by the whole film. I thought it was a thrilling piece of entertainment. Funny, resonant and exciting in equal measure.But again, like so many others I also feel Titanic has lost a bit of its sparkle over the years. Its times like this you ask yourself why a film you once held in such high regard now ranks so low? Lets see if I can answer that question.There's no denying that on the one hand its an impressive piece of filmmaking. Cameron's direction is slick and economical, something that's served him well since his extraordinary debut with The Terminator. The 3 hour running time zips by without one barely noticing. But somewhere along the way, Cameron fumbles it, and like the Titanic, the film goes down with all hands.Cameron is a self-professed Titanic enthusiast, and he's clearly put a great deal of thought, care and precision into recreating the Titanic, from the jumbo sized pistons in the engine room right down to the tiny portholes on the bow. And he exactingly crafts its destruction, first explained to us through a step-by-step computer simulation.The collision with the iceberg. The gradual flooding of the compartments. Loss of power. The ship splits in half. The eventual sinking. And then we finally see it enacted in the last 90 minutes. It would be churlish not to mention how eerily precise Cameron gets the details of the Titanic.Its a shame the human characters aren't as well developed. Cameron's clout in the industry has allowed him to array a truly extraordinary cast. But save one or two, quite a few characters are little more than cardboard cutouts.Kate Winslet shines as Rose. She does quite well and invests a great deal of resourcefulness and spunk into the part of a d√©butante forced into marriage. Cameron draws a lot of strength and vitality from her character.As for Leonardo DiCaprio, he brings plenty of enthusiasm to Jack Dawson, a penniless artist from steerage. But his romance with Rose never truly convinces. The relationship only works on simplistic terms by pushing all the right emotional buttons. Exactly why it struck such a chord with audiences. Especially the female members. I remember hearing quite a few ladies in the audience reach for their tissues during Jack's rather maudlin death scene.I couldn't go into detail describing how many people there are to keep track of. Otherwise I'd run out of words. The ones that scored favourably with me are Kathy Bates as the unsinkable Molly Brown, Victor Garber as Mr Andrews the ship builder, and in a small but memorable role Jason Barry as Tommy, an Irishman in steerage who meets a tragic end.As for everyone else, they're all one-dimensional. Billy Zane is cast as Rose's fianc√©e Cal, a snobbish, controlling tyrant. There's no depth to his character. David Warner is wasted in a thankless role as Zane's ghoulish valet, and Frances Fisher takes the prize of worst offender for playing Ruth, Rose's heartless mother.Cameron waits quite a bit before the actual collision. So you'd be forgiven for feeling more than a little restless for the first hour and a half. There are a few moments that stand out. I quite liked the way the film contrasts the differences in 1st and 3rd class, each having dinner in their own way. And you will definitely sit up and pay attention to Jack drawing Rose in the nude wearing nothing but a priceless diamond.But its really after the crash that the film finally starts getting interesting. This is the part of the story Cameron wanted to tell. He stages the destruction of Titanic with breathtaking regard. Corridors flood with cascades of water. The enormity of the hull pivoting into the air is a terrifying sight. Its in these scenes where the film holds a captive audience. Cameron shoots them with a fanatical immediacy, and watching the destruction of these stylised and impeccably crafted sets is awesome to behold.Yet even in these scenes Cameron miscues it a little. The sinking of the Titanic has been filmed many times (A Night To Remember had to have influenced Cameron). But this is the first to add comedy into the mix. I didn't mind so much in the first half because the people aboard didn't know the maiden voyage of Titanic was doomed. But in the second half, when Cameron tries to make you laugh, its an approach at odds with the dramatic thrust of the story, e.g. the aristocrats aboard want brandies while the ship is sinking. This is hardly believable behaviour, and even disrespects the memories of those aboard. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth.Cameron does demonstrate far too much of a willingness to guess what the people aboard were like. Painting them in unfavourable colours, portraying the officers as officious bureaucrats, and even having one of them shooting passengers even when there is no evidence to support that.The final scenes for Jack and Rose go on too long in my opinion. His final words, which are really hackneyed and mawkish belong more in a soap opera, not a multi-million dollar feature film. The image of a floating necropolis is striking though.Titanic is certainly an oddity. Its a film that people embraced as a whole the world over, and now they go out they're way to find fault with it. I didn't go looking for faults. They surfaced as time went by because it just doesn't hold up too well to repeated viewings. I still think you should see Titanic, even if in a few years it probably won't do for you what it used to.",5/10
Expensive wreck.,rmax304823,20 November 2005,"I've always enjoyed the British version, ""A Night to Remember,"" based on Walter Lord's popular book. Yes, it's black and white, and a bit dated, but it's a straightforward telling of an awesome disaster.The 1953 Hollywood version was a boring soap opera which was set aboard the Titanic simply so that some exciting and dramatic scenes could be tacked on at the end.This one is more like the Hollywood version, only with a budget extended to the power of n. What a wreck! In some shots the ship doesn't seem the size of a man-made artifact at all. It seems impossibly huge, twenty leagues long. When the stern rises into the air and a figure falls from the fantail, the figure dwindles down toward the sea which seems a million miles away, and vanishes except for a minuscule white spot marking its splash point. The Titanic in this movie is colossal, stupendous, magnificent, gargantuan, or -- in a word -- titanic.Before the f/x-resplendent climax we endure a romance between a lower-class handsome young man and a pretty, rich young lady. Now, few people realize this, but this is the first cinematic exploration of the theme of True Love overcoming Class Distinctions. Yes, it's true. Love conquers all and you can be sure that threepence or so will be no more than grist for its mill.The film's full of stereotypical character and they're not worth going into. Well, one example -- the wealthy coward who tries to buy his way into a lifeboat. More examples. (There are so many.) Here are the two lovers clinging to the flagstaff as they plung into the see. ""This is where we first met!"", she says breathlessly. Earlier the couple find a brand new automobile in the cargo. He leaps into the driver's seat and beeps the ancient horn gaily, as in a Walt Disney movie. She sits elegantly in the coach. ""Where to?"" he asks. ""Take me to the stars!,"" she chirps. There's a subplot involving a stolen jewel, straight out of Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes movies. Basically this is a megabuck special effects extravaganza built around a B-movie script.So much is lost. Like the irony of the California, sitting a few miles away, watching and misinterpreting the Titanic's distress rockets. The piling up of personal telegrams that kept the radio officer too busy to tend to the ice warnings.The Titanic disaster was an interesting lesson in sociology though, factually speaking. Women and children only, right? Very gentlemanly. Very Edwardian.And most of the women in first class passage were in fact saved. A far lesser proportion of women and kids in second class were saved, and only a handful from third class. You can actually MEASURE the relative impact of social class, gender, and age.I don't want to make this film sound like the catastrophe that the Titanic's first voyage was. If you liked, say, ""Pearl Harbor,"" you'll probably like this. It has pretty much the same structure.There's something else that occurred to me while watching this though. When should we just leave the real Titanic alone? Some years ago, Telly Savalas was featured in a TV program called something like, ""Treasures from the Titanic,"" in which he displayed and described items retrieved from the wreck and the surrounding sea floor. Savalas gave his best imitation of a carnival barker. You know, smiling, holding up a boot for the camera, pronouncing, ""This was somebody's shoe. Imagine. Someone wearing this shoe as the stately liner made its final descent."" The disarticulated carcass of the Titanic is a giant necropolis, filled with human remains and, who knows?, benthic ghosts. It's a burial ground of sorts. Should we really go searching among the bodies for watches and gold teeth?",5/10

Something amiss...,zetes,10 March 2001,"I understand why every Dick and Jane on the planet liked this, but why did the critics give it such good reviews? I mean, it is not, contrary to popular opinion, the worst movie ever made (although, yes, it may be the most overhyped, although The Matrix and Star Wars: Episode 1 are huge contenders). It is merely bad. There are very few things to like in this film. Technically, it succeeds to a point. I really did believe that I was watching a real ship sink (well, since the model built by Cameron for the film was just barely a model and more a full-sized ship, it ought to look real!). Some of the CGI was terrible, though. The people falling from the boat were so obviously digitally created that I laughed a bit. The writing is extraordinarily weak. Dialogue is just as bad. Everything that happened in the film, which takes over 3 hours, can easily be related on a cocktail napkin. The worst part about it has to be the acting. Kate Winslet has actually been good, elsewhere, but here she has nothing to work with. DiCaprio is bad. There's no saving him - his career, much like that of a boy band, is going down the toilet as I type (he's starting to gain weight and get greasy like Marlon Brando did - this sort of right is only reserved for actors of Brando's status, so stop it now, Leo!). Billy Zane is awful, too, but it is mostly that his part is so insubstantial.So do you believe in payolas? It's beginning to make me curious that such obviously bad films as Titanic, American Pie, and The Matrix all got rave reviews from critics. All three of the films were abominations. And you may ask, what does it matter if a critic reviews it well? I don't care about their opinion! Not true, my friend. Even if your insecurities tell you that critics are unimportant, you always secretly feel victory when the consensus is for a film you really like. Therefore, there are no guilty feelings after you have enjoyed something like Titanic so much. Instead, you feel for a fading second that, yes, you are part of high culture. You understand art. BLAH! It's all just sinister psychology working its claws over simple minds.And for those of you who absolutely despise this film, I can guess your favorite pictures: Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Fight Club, and, of course, The Matrix. Well, you people should actually begin to learn what REAL film is. Rent A Night to Remember, the best film about the Titanic's sinking. It is not the greatest film ever made, but it is great.",4/10

Shakespearean tragedy through and through!,AhmedSpielberg99,7 July 2019,"The increasing slight sense of foreboding, the humour at the climax that doesn't lighten up the tragedy but instead somehow makes it even more unsettling and ominous, the charming and extremely amiable star-crossed protagonists, to name a few. James Cameron's Titanic is one of the best indirect adaptations of Shakespeare's masterwork, Romeo and Juliet. Even when it comes to the issues I have with this film, most of them are pretty much similar to those I have with the play. And I've always found these issues justifiable to some extent. Also, the visuals are uniquely spectacular, and C√©line Dion's My Heart Will Go On is timeless!(8.5/10)",8/10
25th anniversary in theatre,theknownames,14 February 2023,"I was loathe to go to see this in the theater in 2023 however my friend wanted to experience it on the big screen so I obliged . I don't recall loving it when it came out, I was younger and everything was cringe back then. It is still cringe haha but in the best possibly way ! The acting and the pacing ... the unfolding of this story was so well done . It felt like a very short movie Also, having learned some of the facts about how the movie was made overhears and the attention to detail was moving. There was almost a coldness or a sterility to the experience which felt very much the setting on a brand new ship. The characters felt authentic and while of course Jack and Rose were a bit rudimentary ( for lack of a better term ) they were children of the time and their love felt wholesome and innocent against the backdrop of impending doom. The ship , the beautiful detail and it's stunning demise was truly epic ! I saw it in 3D and it didn't feel forced , it was beautiful to watch . Finally ,what I wasn't expecting was to wake up today with such vivid recollections and appreciate for how well this movie was done over time .",9/10
"Beautiful & Impactful, Recreation of the Sinking Magnificent, Winslet & DiCaprio Excellent",Dan_W_Reviews,14 February 2023,"Titanic tells the story of the tragic sinking of the Titanic, as well as the ill-fated love affair of 3rd Class Passenger Jack and Aristocratic Rose. Firstly the film's special effects are magnificent, especially the recreation of the Titanic sinking, which is seriously impressive and greatly add to the film's overall impact. The film's sweeping score and the very memorable love theme, My Heart Will Go On, by Celine Dion, are indispensable parts of the film's beauty.The performances of the are also excellent, with the leads DiCaprio and Winslet delivering truly heartfelt and memorable performances. The film's portrayal of the societal norms of the time and the class divide on the Titanic adds just that extra layer of depth to the film that most others lack and makes it more than just a love story.I'd recommend Titanic to any fans of romantic dramas and anyone who loves a good historical movies. The stunning visuals, the memorable music, and the heartfelt performances make it an enduring classic.",8/10

What an achievement!,ronakkotian,15 July 2019,"James Cameron's Titanic was something else. It's amazing to think how this movie came out in 1997. Titanic is a film that many will remember that broke ground. Not just for the actors involved but for filmmaking in general.Titanic is very, very well made. You can clearly tell that this was a passion project for James Cameron. He wanted to make this movie special and he has. The amount of research that Cameron had to do to make the film look realistic is evident.The entire set is a whole world in itself. Cameron's direction transports us to ins and outs of the ship which all look so beautiful. The atmosphere and grandness of the ship sticks with you especially during the inevitable sinking scene where you can feel the terror and panic aboard. The cinematography is pure brilliance. The ship has a very elegant feel and the set design and costumes from the inside also adds to that feeling. Visually, this is one the best looking films of all time.The acting was sublime all through the film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are in top form and have some of the best chemistry in a film ever. Their romance seemed so believable that I never felt bored during it. The supporting cast are also great, especially Billy Zane.I have to give immense praise to James Cameron for handling this film. He took a lot of time researching and working to make this movie the grand spectacle it is and feel as accurate as possible to the real incident. Whilst some think this film is overrated, you cannot deny the sheer effort that went into crafting this movie.",9/10
A legendary film for all time,alekspredator87,27 July 2022,"James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is undoubtedly an epoch-making movie created by a master director. The picture is one of three that took 11 Academy Awards at once, including the best film, direction, cinematography, sound and visual effects. This is an excellent indicator of how high-quality the film came out from all sides of consideration.For decades after the release of the film, the film has acquired the most interesting facts about the filming and about the most legendary sunken liner. This is the creation of a mock-up of a ship in 75 percent of the size of the real ship, a mirror image of the liner on the motion picture at the time of the ship's departure due to the fact that the layout was made only on one side of the Titanic, and the real ship was moored by the other side, a huge picture budget of 200 million US dollars, which turned out to be more than the construction of the liner itself at the prices of 1997 and much more. However, the picture is remembered not at all by these statistical data, which can not be found even today. ""Titanic"" takes an unprecedented love story of two young people, a story that was so carefully and accurately placed in real events on a huge ship that launched in April 1912 on its first and, unfortunately, its last journey.James Cameron approached this project already being a masterful director and screenwriter. He created his project so as to please, it seems, everyone. Many genres are closely intertwined in the film. ""Titanic"" is a drama, a thriller, a disaster movie. Attention was paid to every detail. After all, we know how seriously Cameron approaches his work and demands the same serious approach from his subordinates. Probably, creating the ""Titanic"", otherwise it would be impossible to do. Then the world would not have seen this masterpiece, which can be admired even decades later.In addition to the global production, the gorgeous visual component and the magnificent soundtrack from James Horner, it is necessary to mention the well-chosen actors. Each of the characters allows you to reveal the acting talent of the artists. Actors also endow their characters with an unprecedented energy, which you definitely get into. You believe the actors, you believe in the fate of their heroes, in their decisions, which will necessarily lead to certain consequences.Of course, the acting works of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet stand apart here. Their pair on the screen looks great. The chemistry between the actors is felt, thereby allowing the characters to become truly close to each other, even in the short few days that they have known each other. Maybe this kind of love is from the category of fiction, but it is a work of fiction. Let it be so - love at first sight, which teaches viewers to be selfless for the sake of their loved ones and loved ones.Leo and his Jack Dawson shine on the screen. DiCaprio allows you to enjoy the variety of his acting skills in three hours of the film. His character evolves from an ordinary flighty 19-year-old to a person who knows how to make responsible decisions, who is ready to save the life of a loved one and knows how to do it.Kate in the role of Rose gives an opportunity to see the difficult fate of a young person already engaged at the age of 17, who does not yet understand what kind of life she can enter by marrying an essentially unloved person. For Rose, getting to know Jack becomes a kind of push to rethink everything, to understand that she does not need the rich life she is used to, she wants something else. Sometimes it is very important to see yourself from the outside in time, especially if this allows you not to pass the point of no return, which will determine your future fate.Other characters performed by Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stewart, Bernard Hill, Evan Stewart and others are also good. I would like to mention literally everyone, because the actors gave unforgettable images of the characters, regardless of their screen time and influence on the plot. A decent game allows you to really believe in everything that happens on the ship.The story of the drama and the relationship between the main characters may seem naive to someone. Feelings that suddenly flared up, a short period of time for their development. All this may well resemble a kind of falling in love, rather than real feelings. Especially if we talk about young people who have not yet gained life experience and are quite capable and even ready to make mistakes. Well, let it be. It's a movie. It is important to understand something else. This is a general picture and a story that is placed in a certain situation. What if the shipwreck hadn't happened? How would two lovers live on? Would they have coped with the test of their feelings with time? There are many other questions. It is quite possible that nothing would have come of this pair. However, it is important that their age, worldview, more naive thoughts due to just the same age led to the fact that the story became legendary for the audience. A kind of analogue of Romeo and Juliet. After all, it was thanks to their actions that each of them learned true love, the desire to save each other. The catastrophe that happened on the ship forced us to make fateful decisions, to take responsibility. That's what's important.As a result, the audience got a great story that will forever remain in the hearts of people. The majestic liner ""Titanic"", the way to the New World, unprecedented love, a heartbreaking catastrophe and an endless sense of bitterness, which, it seems, could not escape from those who survived this shipwreck and were able to stay alive. After all, one way or another, they remained with themselves and in front of thousands of faces of those who could not get out of that terrible story alive.""Titanic"" is a legendary project by James Cameron, which makes people of different generations look at this story as something that warms the soul. After all, even in the face of a deadly catastrophe, people can fall in love with each other, become worthy saviors and remain in memory throughout the lives of those they saved.10 out of 10.",10/10

"With better characters, the romance might actually merit the running time",Mr-Fusion,8 September 2017,"Well, it's not ""Avatar"" levels of disappointment, but ""Titanic"" is far from Cameron's best work. Don't get me wrong, there's a great disaster epic here, but you've gotta work for it. The actual iceberg doesn't appear until 100 minutes in. A hundred. That's a lot of forced love story to slog through before real dread starts to build. And the less said about that song, the better.This isn't a bad movie, and it's technically proficient when the effects take center stage.

Bloated *Epic* With Fictionalized Love Story,ScottAmundsen,19 December 2010,"I detested this movie so much when I first saw it that I really wanted to give it one star, but as bad as I still think it is, it is fairly well-made and at least the technical department earned their salaries here (though quite frankly I thought that some of the CGI effects screamed ""FAKE!"" louder than the scale models used by Roy Ward Baker in 1958's A NIGHT TO REMEMBER). What sinks this movie for me (pun very much intended) is the fictional love story forcibly inserted by Cameron, doubtless with the cynical intention of attracting teenage girls. Which it did. By the millions.When Oscar time rolled around, Hollywood apparently decided that 1997 was the year to call the movie that made the most money *Best Picture,* to say nothing of the other ten Oscars it won, plus three nominations. Now I have not seen every movie ever to win the Best Picture Oscar, but of all the ones I have seen, this one has to be the least deserving of the honor.For starters, aside from the fictional romance, there is nothing new here. I made mention above of Roy Ward Baker's 1958 film A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, which is THE definitive dramatic film about the Titanic disaster: there are no fictional characters, no romantic heroes or heroines; Baker chose to tell the story plainly, in an almost documentary fashion that still carries a huge wallop fifty-two years later.Cameron's film, by comparison, though it is wonderful to look at (obviously no expense was spared, from costumes to special effects), is a curiously cold and uninvolving piece of work except for when Leo and Kate are on the screen. Cameron's fatal mistake was that he forgot that the Titanic disaster was a real-life human drama; Roy Ward Baker knew this, and his film, fully an hour-and-a-half SHORTER than this one, yet manages to show the terrible loss of humanity of all classes that terrible night. Cameron's film has little feeling for any of the subsidiary characters, with a couple of exceptions, such as a lusty Kathy Bates, delightful as the unsinkable Molly Brown, and Gloria Stuart, who at eighty-eight came out of retirement to play Rose at age one hundred-one.Unfortunately these bright spots are too far and few between in a much- too-long movie that cannot escape the fact that the central romance is uninteresting at best, and irritating at worst. Cameron shows a shameless disregard for his actors in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio is not the least bit convincing as a young man from 1912; he comes across as a typical California brat who grew up eating Sugar Pops. Kate Winslet, a terrific actress, is horribly misused here; left to her own devices, she often fails to find the right notes, most noticeably towards the end, when she and Leo climb the ship to the near-vertical stern, and she turns to him and squeals, ""This is where we first met!"" The line is awful in and of itself, especially in the context of that moment, but had she delivered it with tears streaming down her cheeks and a great deal of pathos, it might have been palatable. Instead, she sounds like a teenage girl going to a high-school dance.There are a few other good performances in the supporting cast in addition to the two I have mentioned, but unfortunately they and the rest of what was a true-life story of hubris, heroics, class divisions, and self-sacrifice, are buried under the cheap date-movie romance that Cameron inserted. I'll give him credit for one thing: he knew that the love story was what would keep the viewers coming back; had he chosen to simply tell the true story, I don't know if the film would have sunk faster than the ship did, but it most certainly would not have gotten all the undeserved acclaim that it did.If you haven't seen A NIGHT TO REMEMBER yet, get it. Compare the two and see the difference honest storytelling can make to a movie.",3/10
A historical and memorable film,johnny-89987,27 January 2021,"It's really unfortunate when you see a movie as big and good as the Titanic and not in the top 250, while some of the other movies are weaker than this movie on this list, and that's not good. 10/10",10/10
An incredibly beautiful movie that holds up on every watch,Dragoneyed363,16 May 2008,"There are many who say Titanic is ""overrated"", ""over-hyped"" or some might inexplicably go as far to say ""boring"" and ""pointless"". The hardly arguable biggest blockbuster of the 90s, grossing near 2 billion at the box office and winning 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, has attained some hate from people over the years, people who love to hate this movie for everything they so wrongly think it is not and never will be. It has, however, attained a very positive social status among a lot of people whom their hearts were captured by this masterpiece. Those people can see just how magnificent of a movie this really is, and how underrated a classic it appears to be in today's film society; a dazzling and striking accomplishment in itself and never overlooked, but unfairly maligned by many.The movie, aside from being set on the Titanic and called Titanic, actually has a love story that renders up most of the movie time, as most would already know. This love story, is positively brilliant in every sense of the word. I am always amazed and captivated to watch it play out on screen, because Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who were furiously snubbed out of Best Actor/Actress awards, have wonderful chemistry, giving me chills in lots of scenes, and they both separately give incredulous performances that enthrall and charm every step of the way as well. These two characters' strong likability, along with James Cameron's directing and the entirely fascinating special effects make this movie something much more than mere entertainment. The movie is excellently executed in the best manner it could be, the Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart present day story being very interesting as well, and a lot of the film's aspects are quite simply riveting and awe-inspiring whether it's the love story, the intensity in all the performances or the infamous, brilliantly portrayed sinking and sets that give true heart to the story of the Titanic and shows it's revelation quite undeniably like any other film on the subject.While ""My Heart Will Go On"", receiving the Academy Award for Best Original Song, has attained some criticism from people as well, it makes the perfect score and theme song for every scene it is used in regarding the movie, especially the climax, which has had millions in tears, had me in tears, and always has me in tears when I watch it, even if it is not the saddest movie of all time, because it isn't. It's a film about love, a film about disaster, a film about memories, and it is beautifully shown how all of those three attributes tie into peoples' lives, but I am not melancholy, I am merely pleased with how stunning of a film it is, and how remarkably well it has held up over the years, not being overthrown by any blockbusters in recent years in likes of quality, in my honest opinion. James Cameron, even if not one of my favorite directors, is very talented and it shows with this movie. I do not understand a lot of the reasons why so many hate this, or do not find it as remarkable of a film as fans like me do, but I ensure you, this movie will always have a place in my heart, and will go down as a classic, already has even and will contine to whether haters like it or not, because of how many people were touched by it and are still touched by it. Underrated, powerful, breath-taking movie that, since holding up in quality on every watch, I intend to love for many more years to come.",10/10
Pop culture perfection,guskeller,8 February 2022,"Titanic is pop culture perfection. It's everything wide audiences crave and has elite craft. Even the writing (its weakest aspect) is fair. The love story is generic, but it's efficient and accents the dramatic disaster. In some ways, that romance is just right because the setting is already complex. More nuance could've overly complicated the film. Sometimes, simplicity is not only desired by audiences, but also required by circumstances. Meanwhile, the acting is quality. Leo is fine, Winslet is great, and the supporting cast is strong. All together, this provides the ideal amount of emotional investment to synergize with Titanic's grand spectacle.Despite Titanic's sentimentality, its filmmaking is its core. Each ingredient supports a sense of grandeur that elevates the experience. The steady camerawork is constantly sweeping, emphasizing the ship's scale and heightening the action. The elaborate sound symbolically amplifies the daunting ocean and immense tragedy. The editing begins gracefully and smoothly builds energy during the chaos. The music is iconic, elegant, and fitting. The production is incredibly elaborate and detailed. The effects are dedicated, real, and versatile. Lastly, the passionate direction wholly commits to authenticity, emotion, and excitement, making Titanic a truly captivating experience. Ultimately, Titanic has it all.Writing: 7/10

Incredible Movie Making,TheRothOfKhan,7 December 2019,"An absolutely spellbinding film that still holds up over 20 years later. I first saw this as a 12-year-old in 1997 and recall being utterly captivated by the story, the imagery, the characters, the score and the sheer spectacle of it all. 'Titanic' was an event, not just a film. There was nothing like it before, and there has been nothing like it since.
Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, both relatively unknown actors at the time of the film's original release, shine as Jack and Rose, two young people from opposite ends of the social spectrum who are brought together by fate against the backdrop of one of history's greatest tragedies. Winslet steals every scene with her portrayal of a deeply unhappy woman thrust into an engagement of convenience at the behest of her domineering mother, only finding happiness and her true self when she crosses paths with di Caprio's Jack Dawson. Tragedy inevitably strikes however, and it becomes a fight for survival as the great ship Titanic founders. For all of the special effects, it is the chemistry between Winslet and di Caprio that drives the film. If you have ever become infatuated with someone in a very short space of time, then it is very easy to relate to the relationship between Jack and Rose. They perfectly capture the intensity of infatuation and the recklessness of youth. Other excellent characters include Billy Zane's charming but abrasive Cal Hockley, Frances Fisher's sneering Ruth Dewitt Bukater and Kathy Bates' bolshy Molly Brown. Finally, the great Gloria Stewart portrays 'old' Rose with such sincerity and heart that it is difficult to believe she didn't live through all of this in real life.",10/10
All for sets and costuming,mls4182,30 May 2023,"The attention to detail on the sets and scale models is Oscar worthy. The same can be said about consuming.The writing is abysmal. James Cameron makes his points with a sledgehammer. Every word of dialogue is exposition.The fictional romance between Jack and Rose is nausea inducing. He goes overboard trying to establish Jack as a cool, brave, daredevil bad boy. He's actually a loser with nothing to give a woman. Rose is portrayed as a very proper young lady with an enviable pedigree yet one that should be resented because of privilege. One would think a teenager wrote this screepllay. Even Molly Brown comes across as stale.Again, try to ignore this and focus of the sets and costuming.",7/10
Has Flaws But Is Still Very Good.,Ggconte,14 June 2022,"Being a huge follower of the story of Titanic and it's tragic history, this was a movie that stood out to me from day one of its development. Most films or shows that were about the ship only told the story of the sinking without really going into too much detail about the voyage itself. Director and Writer James Cameron really wanted to change this approach and tell the most detailed story of the ship ever presented in film.The story centers around a fictional survivor named Rose, who is telling her story to a group of archeologists who are out the find a long lost diamond believed to have belonged to her but is also believed to have gone down with the ship. Rose was a first class passenger who was set to marry a wealthy man to whom she did not love. She meets a man named Jack Dawson, whom she falls in love with, creating a dangerous jealous attitude with her possessive fianc√©. Through their eyes, we see the voyage of Titanic and meet many of the historical figures that were on the ship.I think it goes without saying that James Cameron is one of the best Directors/Writers in Hollywood and when he commits to a project he is far from lazy with his filmmaking and style. Titanic is no exception and this man built every remade setting and room from the ship that would be featured in the film to exact detail, right down to the tiniest spec. He then rebuilt the entire 800+ foot exterior of the ship, which is just insane. He also went down to see the actual wreck to research and gather footage.I do like the level of detail that Cameron presents about the ship within the film. I don't think any other director would have had the skill or patience to pull this story off.As detailed as the movie is, one flaw that this film does repeat from other Titanic films is featuring a fictional plot in the middle of this true story.The love story between Jack and Rose (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) has its moments but comes off as almost George Lucas' writing style for quite a bit of it. The element that saves it for the most part is the chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet. It's really that chemistry that almost helps you ignore that they say each other's names about 50,000 times in this film.Also, incorporating a villain into the story is a bit overdone with the character of Caledon (Billy Zane) being very over the top.However, as I stated before, where Cameron doesn't miss with this movie is the story of Titanic itself. Cameron goes over the obvious about the ship but also goes through details that weren't ever explained in film before, for instance Thomas Andrews and Bruce Ismay are given far more story than in previous films and the ships voyage itself is incredibly detailed.However, there may be no other film that has a more real or suspenseful sinking. Cameron goes to great lengths, through practical and digital effects, to recreate the sinking. A sequence that still looks tremendous to this day.The sinking takes up almost two hours of the three in this movie and it is one of the most emotional sequences I've ever seen in film. Once it's over and old Rose (Gloria Stuart) is on screen discussing how few were saved from the water, that hits so hard.Also, as mixed opinionated as I am over the love story, it does lead to a very heart wrenching ending.The acting is simply tremendous. This is a near perfect cast that really elevates the film.The musical score is also unique. The late James Horner composed the score for the film and while it can come off as a bit poppy at times, it is tremendous as well.So overall, I'm polarized over the fictional element of the film but the story of the ship itself is amazing. Its one of those films that you really have to see at least once.",8/10
"Good, but overrated.",Boba_Fett1138,25 November 2002,"I saw the movie for the first time when it arrived on video, needless to say that I had very high expectations for this movie because I heard a lot about it. I watched the movie and I remembered my first reaction when I finished watching it, my reaction was: ""This is it?"" Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, not at all. But I was disappointed about it all and it just didn't met my expectations.Everybody knows the true story about the ship the ""Titanic"" and there are many movies/series made about it already. New about this movie is the love story. It's always dangerous to put a love story in a movie because if the love story doesn't work the movie doesn't work. The love story does work for most parts in this movie, except for some scene's in which I just don't buy it.Although the movie is very long it doesn't really ever get boring, which is of course a good thing. The best part of the movie is the sinking and you can see that James Cameron is really one of the best Action directors in the business.The acting isn't great but not bad either. The special effects look good with the exception of a few needless scene's. The movie is also full of visual mistakes (for instance you can clearly see the camera in a scene, which is a HUGE mistake that I noticed on my first viewing) and the characters in my opinion aren't really interesting enough.Although the movie got more credit then it really deserved I can still recommend this movie to everybody. Good but not perfect...7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7/10
"Your usual James Cameron movie - all style, no substance",grantss,18 April 2016,"A typical James Cameron movie, i.e. all style, no substance, and excruciatingly long. Plot is basic - love story set against the Titanic tragedy, that's it. Just basically drifts for 3.25 hours around that central plot. The direction is all about the amazing special effects, another Cameron trademark.On the plus side, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are excellent in the lead roles, and their interaction is spot-on. This movie pretty much launched their careers (well, in DiCaprio's case, shifted it up several notches).",5/10
Watching This........I Got a Sinking Feeling,werefox08,6 July 2012,"Technically this can hardly be faulted. As a spectacle...its very good. For a three hours plus movie it moves along ..OK. There are however, major problems with Titanic. (its NOT un-sinkable !!) The two leads Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio cant sustain a hot romance throughout the entire movie...indeed the chemistry is never quite right between the two.(Di Caprio in particular is ""out of his depth"" here) Both actors (even apart from the relationship problem) are not at their best. Perhaps the gigantic nature of the project ""got to them"".The supporting cast play this...like they are on a ship that will hit a huge ice berg. The dialogue is another problem. It lacks any feeling or spontaneity, and some of the language sounds too modern. The hype surrounding this movie before release was incredible (garaunteeing a successful picture) If your happy with technology and amazing special effects...this is your movie. But don't look too close....there are cracks here....",4/10
The most undeserving of praise in the history of film,ToldYaSo,9 May 1999,"What I think I'll probably like best about the new Star Wars film, ""Phantom Menace"", is that it will likely blow ""Titanic"" out of the water, if you'll pardon the pun, when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts, and thereby knock it out of the number one spot. Every time I hear someone declare ""Titanic"" is the greatest film they've ever seen, I think to myself, ""You don't see a lot of movies, do you?"" What a travesty. You could make 50 good films that are a lot better than ""Titanic"", and for the same price tag.""Well, it won lots of academy awards, lots of people really loved it,"" as someone might say in its defence. Well, lots of people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that doesn't mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans CAN be wrong.I'll be the first to admit, that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype over the film. I waited a month or so to see it and ultimately, it didn't live up to the expectations set upon it, which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story. It's true, ""Phantom Menace"" will likely suffer a similar fate. but.James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is. a)  a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece. b)  a three-hour epic that has it's finest moments given away in the trailer. c)  a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d)  something left better to documentarians, which I would've enjoyed much more. e)  a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship. f)  a  robbery of 3 hours that I will never get back, therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine I can think of. When I meet someone who hasn't seen it yet, I say, ""I wish I could trade places with you."" g)  a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia. How long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences? h)  thankfully a film that wasn't recognized for any acting achievements at the Oscars. i)  a technological achievement in filmmaking, and little else.The only reason I post this as a anonymous comment is I do NOT welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 thirteen year old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who'll no doubt come to his defense, and I am not really interested in hearing a defense of Titanic's story, acting or length.",1/10
The King Of The World meets The Bitch Of The Sea.,dunmore_ego,27 May 2006,"Let's get one thing straight before we embark on this perilous journey into Hollywood History: the only ""truth"" in this movie is that the RMS Titanic did sink in April 1912 and that Leonardo DiCaprio is prettier than Kate Winslet. Everything else in James Cameron's *Titanic* is marshmallow fancy.Movie opens in the modern Atlantic, with a Titanic salvage crew helmed by amiable Brock Lovett (sun-weathered Bill Paxton), who haul surfaceward some intriguing artifacts. 84-year-old Rose (Gloria Stuart) claims she was a Titanic passenger, so is brought aboard Lovett's vessel to provide information.In a cheeky foreshadowing of the breath-hammering visuals to come, Lovett's crewmate outlines Titanic's death throes, aided by computer graphics (probably the selfsame graphics that the actual movie used as storyboard for its final visuals), before Lovett asks Rose for a firsthand account of the RMS Titanic and she, in a rheumy Percodan haze, starts relating a chick flick with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.And under the chick flick, the film's main premise - a story of White Pride, saut√©ed in eleven million gallons of seawater.Rose's narration is the anomaly that eats at this film's verisimilitude: though we humor her spinning her tale of irrelevant romantic rhetoric, when it comes to events outside her sphere of experience (such as private meetings between the captain and crew), she relates them as if omniscient (if we are to regard all the film's action aboard Titanic as her testimony). Even the iceberg impact is comprehensively covered from all angles (from the lookouts, to the bridge, to the engine room, captain and crowd) by Rose's ""flashback."" Not bad for someone who was backseat bonking her body-shaved boy-man at the time.Rose laments that she ""doesn't even have a picture of Jack,"" her steerage-class lover (Leonardo DiCaprio). Maybe that's why she remembers him as so staggeringly beautiful.It's a pity that writer-director Cameron leaned so heavily on the vapid love story as this movie's propeller, as the rest of the film is a chest-clenching stunner.The grandeur of the Royal Mail Ship Titanic is beautifully captured in its restored filmic incarnation. Costuming, characters and exterior shots are paid the utmost detail ¬ñ although it must be said that, historically at least, DiCaprio's character (Jack) was probably treading a time period more acquainted with the use of recreational drugs with his yells of ""Woooo!"" from the ship's prow. His friend, Fabrizio (Danny Nucci), didn't help with the authenticity; supplied by a casting agency specializing in Ethnic Stereotypes, Nucci is about as Italian as a Domino's Pizza, sporting the absolute worst ""Movie Italian"" accent of all time ¬ñ the exact same accent my friends and I would adopt in the schoolyard when we were ""pretending to be Italian."" Winning their tickets in a card game, Jack and Fabrizio are overjoyed even in their steerage quarters¬Ö ¬ÖWhilst above the water line, onto the first class decks desultorily rambles Rose (Kate Winslet) with her demanding mother (Frances Fisher), stormy fianc√© (Billy Zane) and luggage enough to kill three pack-elephants. Elbow-gloved and triple-corseted, she remarks via voice-over, ""To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in chains."" Try telling that to an African-American, honey, in your big feathery hat and frothy bloomers.Meeting Jack during a spoiled brat suicide attempt, Rose is drawn to his vagabond swagger and hairless torso, falling for idiot lines like, ""You've got a fire inside you and I'd hate to see it go out."" (George Lucas wrote that one.) The film world does not communicate ""smell."" The super-privileged have a way of ""deodorizing"" themselves that is wholly alien to the super-poor. Hence, no matter how much prettier Jack is than Rose, as soon as she stood downwind of his below-decks stench, the romance would have come to an earthy halt (retching optional).Instead, Jack is invited to sup with the pinky-raisers, where he blathers about his itinerant lifestyle as if it was a blessing; living the devil-may-care bum's life of cobbling his sustenance from whatever rat-brained scheme comes along, and literally not knowing ""where he'll be sleeping the next night"" may be a romantic notion if you are a successful writer or an independently wealthy traveler ¬ñ but not if you are, in fact, a REAL BUM.An ocean liner has to sink before Rose lets go of this vagrant (whilst staying in Spoiled Byoch character by selfishly hogging the one floating plank in all of the Atlantic).A well-made, mind-numbing romance this cheesy usually scores low ¬ñ but Cameron gained his points purely due to his magnificent boat-tipping.The climax of *Titanic* is a startling visualization of an historic event which no one alive on earth today saw first hand. Drawing from the latest forensic knowledge, combined with the physics of the process, Cameron places us directly on deck during his nightmare vision. We see the situation mount, from berg impact and apathy, to incredulity and ultimately panic, capturing the violent and colossal majesty of the ship breaking in half and pulling its aft section downwards vertically.The death throes of the RMS Titanic are astounding in their realism; we cannot help but compare the final scenes of *A Night To Remember*, with its wholly inaccurate, romantic portrayal of the doomed passengers aboard that black-and-white Titanic singing nobly together as their ship slipped away under them at a 45 degree angle. Not only is collective humanity never that level-headed, the physics of the sinking process was entirely ignored.With humanity onboard Cameron's boat ignobly screaming and selfishly grasping and punching and shooting and falling violently onto propeller blades, with smokestacks crushing passengers, decks splintering, cables whiplashing through foaming brine, and the final cataclysmic submersion at a vertiginous ninety-degree angle, Cameron's *Titanic* is ¬ñ titanic!If even for a brief, awe-inspiring moment in time, it's good to be the King of the World.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",7/10
Undeniably Brilliant and Iconic,heisenberg12,7 May 2022,"Is it one of my favorite movies? No. Is it one of the greatest movies Hollywood ever made? Yes. Titanic is objectively one of the greatest movies of all time, and it's undeniable.What works against it are the incredibly long runtime of over 3 hours, which can dredge along on rewatches at the beginning, and the fact that it's a Romance movie, which will likely turn off many male viewers who prefer action, thrillers, and some dramas. So while it's among the best movies of all time, it does have drawbacks for certain audiences.Titanic excels best in the third and final act, the last hour or so, when they strike the iceberg and just before that as the romance heats up more. There it evolves into an action-packed, heart racing thriller with lots of moving parts. Beyond the unforgettable and realistic spectacle of the sinking ship (which amazingly makes you feel like you are right there), there is still plenty of story left to be told, and no matter how strong you think you are, this movie will pull at even the most stoic person's heartstrings, quite a tearjerker for most people.It's a true epic. Director Cameron's ambition (the most expensive movie ever made at the time over 200 million in 1997) and commitment to consistency and quality being quite the ""movie"" experience, Kate Winslet's unforgettable lead performance as Rose (how did she not win the Oscar?; she should have), and the emotional components set in front of the background of one of the most infamous disasters of the 20th century, all factor into making Titanic one of the most groundbreaking and iconic love story movies of all-time.9/10.",9/10

A romantic movie based on a tragic event,kimberlyely-27550,15 July 2023,"TitanicIn 1912, The Titanic was transporting 2,240 passengers to the United States. Four days later the ship hit an iceberg, only 706 people survived. Years later, in 1997, Cameron wrote, directed, and co-produced a movie based on these true events. It stars Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart, and Victor Garber.This movie tells a story about two fictional characters, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). They are from too different social classes, Jack doesn't have a lot of money, where Rose's family is rich, along with her mom wanting her to marry into a wealthy family.The combination of practical affects, CGI, and set designs, made everything including the ship sinking look real. The water scenes were filmed in water tanks and made to look like the Atlantic Ocean, this is an impressive accomplishment of the crew.Winslet does a good job portraying someone who is carefree, yet doesn't like her life with her fianc√© she's supposed to marry. DiCaprio plays a charming guy who teaches Rose that she can just be herself. Together, they make a convincing couple. Its obvious Jack loves Rose, due to the decisions he makes towards the end. Billy Zane gives a strong performance, as he makes the audience dislike him, because of how he mistreats Rose. Titanic is a romantic yet sad movie, based on a tragic true story.",7/10
Breathtaking,cherylkyrandia,26 April 2023,Titanic has got to be one of the best films of all times. James Cameron delivers on this retelling of a real-life tragedy about a ship wreck after a cruise ship hits a glacier. But this is more than a retelling of a real-life tragedy - it's a story of unlikely love between an upper class woman and a lower class fellow in the early part of the 1900s. It's a truly breath-taking tale with some deep tragedy inherent to the story described above. The cinematography and special effects were pretty outstanding for a film from the 90s.

Even though I will say that Kate Winslet was above and beyond in this movie! I will say Titanic and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind has gave me so much appreciation for her acting skills. I only knew her from the Titanic when I was a kid and didn't know how much of an amazing actress she was. But I was really impressed with her in this role. Also I don't know if it was just the Bluray disc I watched or maybe it's just always been this way, but there were some CGI that did not hold up at all.

I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.You jump - I jump.Titanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.Never let go.So may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It's what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10",9/10
Appalling- even Leo could not save it.,beresfordjd,22 December 2016,"While I admit that the effects were good and the costumes worked - the film as a whole was awful. Kate Winslett was horribly miscast and there was no chemistry between her character and DiCaprio's Jack. The script was dire and the baddies were just missing their twirly moustaches. It was difficult to care about what happened to anyone at any point during the interminable denouement. it seemed to me that like many other Cameron movies the bottom line was the profit to be made from the extreme overhyping of the whole thing. Avatar was only just better (which is not to say it was any good either). Definitely the law of diminishing returns was played out here. I think it halted Leo's career in it's tracks, given the ""heartthrob"" title attributed to him. Conversely and inexplicably it boosted Kate's career beyond any explanation.",4/10
"""The ship will sink"".",classicsoncall,18 August 2011,"Imagine being the Captain of The Titanic and told by it's architect that it will sink with absolute mathematical certainty. Immediate denial sets in but the instincts are too strong. The most incredible machine ever built by human hands will lie on the bottom of the ocean floor in a matter of hours, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. The sheer horror of it reels the imagination.It took me a long time to get past the hype of the film's original release. Sometimes it's better to let all that hoopla pass and see a picture on it's own merits rather than on the recommendation of anyone and everyone. While watching, I tended to key in on the historical elements of the voyage rather than the love story. Realizing that most films like this rely on a romance to move the picture along, I'm willing enough to go along with it. To go too far in the other direction would move it toward a documentary, and there are enough of those around if that's what you're after.I was fairly impressed with the technical aspects of the picture regarding the disaster. Following Ismay's (Jonathan Hyde) analysis of how the Titanic would take on water and sink, and actually seeing it play out made for some dramatic special effects. What's almost impossible to comprehend is how the passengers on board ship might have actually reacted on that fateful night. The calamity of it is absolutely mind boggling and difficult to contemplate.I give director Cameron and the special effects folks all the credit there is for producing an epic disaster film. DiCaprio and Winslet perform capably, though I wasn't necessarily wowed by their portrayals. Even if your only motivation to see the picture is it's inclusion as one of the top grossing pictures of all time, you shouldn't be disappointed.",9/10
A Film So Bad It's Obscene,Theo Robertson,28 March 2002,"TITANIC is actually two films. The first film is a very unlikely love story so syrupy it can cause diabetes. Then it suddenly mutates into a James Bond film where - wait for this - Bond is played by Kate Winslet. Maybe this isn't entirely accurate because James is total fantasy , but never becomes as unbelievable as this. Oh and at least in a Bond film the Brits are the good guys unlike here where they are invaribly cruel , stupid and/or cowardly. Also at no point in a Bond film does a script change the laws of physics where it's possible for someone to escape from the undercurrants of a ship weighing thousands of tons. Oh and the special effects are better in Bond films , TITANIC's are not entirely convincing.But the most fantastic thing about TITANIC isn't the fact it made so much money at the box office ( This is explained by 14 year old girls lining up at the cinema to watch Leonardo for the 25th time ) but the fact this film won 11 ( Yes Eleven.You read that right ) Oscars, equalling the total held by BEN HUR. What the hell were the Academy thinking ? I know they didn't give any awards for the quality of the acting or even nominated the screenplay for an Oscar ( They got that right . Boy did they get that right ) but for it to win 11 Oscars including Best Picture ( Didn't any of the voters watch LA CONFIDENTIAL ? ) really upset me because films like GONE WITH THE WIND , etc didn't get that many",4/10
The worst film to ever win a best picture Oscar,PureCinema,28 January 1999,"Checking out the other comments, one caught my eye... somebody had the gall to make a comparison between this film and Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, ""The Seven Samurai"". To compare this film with ""The Seven Samurai"" is utterly rediculous and an insult to great films. With that said, I'll continue...Let me start off with the absolute horrid screenplay that is filled with cliches. While watching this film, you can pretty much tell what is going to happen next... it's the ""Rich girl forced to marry a rich guy, but she finds a poor boy that she eventually falls in love with"" story you've seen hundereds of times before.... add a big boat, a historical disaster, and bingo, you have yourself a movie. The dialogue is almost laughably bad (""Oh Jack.... Jack!""). And the characters are almost as cliche-ridden as the story they're in. As you watch the film, you feel almost as if you're forced to like the characters.A disaster as huge as the sinking of the Titanic doesn't deserve a film like this. It is an insult to the hundreds that died in that distaster to be represented in a stereotypical film such as this. And it's winning of the best picture oscar is absolute proof that the Oscars are nothing more than a huge popularity contest anymore. To even place this in the same category with films like ""On the Waterfront"", ""Ben-Hur"", ""The African Queen"", ""Rebecca"", ""The Godfather"", etc. is such a shame, and just shows you what direction the film industry is headed.About the only good thing I could say about this film is that it is an enormous technical achievement. The recreation of the ship itself is amazing, but that alone cannot carry a film with a recycled, cliche-ridden plot such as this.",3/10

The rest of the movie was Meh, didn't care for the love interest between the two leads, but it gave the movie some momentum.Its well done and worth watching, it's entertaining and overall a great movie. If you've never watched it because you feel like you know what happened and don't need like 2 hours of love-story to tell you the story, I get it.

Dear God,emperor_bender,9 May 2008,"This movie right here is ""Overrating"" in its prime.""The most compelling movie of the century"". That's a joke.My question is: Why? Why Cameron? Why did you do it??? You're WAY better than this! But, since Cameron created some cinematic masterpieces like ""The Terminator"" and ""Aliens"", I'm willing to let this one slide. You got lucky this time, Cameron.This movie was nothing but one misplaced drama scene after another. And it wasn't like you could sit through them easily either, this movie was more than 3 hours long! I understand that a lot of people liked this movie, and that maybe I'm being biased, but I really did not like this ""garbage"".Don't get me wrong, there were some very good scenes, and some music score that was decent. But the tear jerker moments grew tiresome quickly. Why are Billy Zane and Bill Paxton wasting their time here? Good scenes and some interesting plot points could not save this mess of a bad drama. I'm sorry, but this Hollywood trash reeks and stains the true story of the Titanic, almost to the point of disgracing it.If you like too much drama and romance badly put together with bad acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, ""Titanic"" is what you want.4/10",4/10

Best Picture?????????,thatsweetbird,5 March 2005,"Are there lesser films in execution and entertainment? Of course. But I felt a ""One"" vote was deserved here for the overratedness of this movie by box-office and awards. I think the Oscars should be embarrassed this won all those Oscars, including Best Picture. As another commenter pointed out, it is funny that such a bloated film won ""Best Editing"". Honestly, this winning Best Picture would be like ""Ghost"" winning that award: a popular, sappy movie with pretty leads.. Only this lacks the actually humorous Whoopi...The ""romance"" is laughable. I like Winslet. She has at least tried to steer clear of this type of stuff since. Actually, mostly, so has DeCrapio...Malcolm X and Gandhi's lives: those are worthy of three hours(plus) of film..NOT this ""eternal romance""..Some people are simply impressed by the sinking. I'm sorry, but if there isn't one person on the ship I care about, the sinking does not mean much to me. Spectacle? Try nature. Go watch a volcano...BTW, I will say I think it is hilarious that people refer to Winslet as a ""cow"" in this because she isn't an anorexic actress. I honestly initially was perplexed whom they were even referring to, because Bates isn't even all that fat. Like they wouldn't want Kate as their girlfriend? Come on...I would certainly never want to see this one again...The script fails to portray an ""eternal love"". Rather it gives us a bit of lust. While it is believable Winslet doesn't want to be permanently with Zane, why she has to be with Leo is not shown...I t is encouraging that this is not in the IMDb Top 250...Perhaps the worst film to ever win Best Picture.",1/10
Romeo and Juliet on a Boat.,anaconda-40658,30 December 2015,"Titanic (1997): Dir: James Cameron / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton: It became the biggest box office hit at the time indicating an event in history that plays off an interesting premise. A drawing of a woman is discovered within the ruins of the Titanic and after news coverage she appears at one hundred years old to bring reality to the historical tragedy. Director James Cameron showcases exquisite production and art direction at its most seamless and breathtaking just as he did with other big budget hits such as The Terminator and Aliens. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a drifter who steers Kate Winslet away from a potential suicide. She is caught within an arranged engagement where she grows increasingly sick of the lifestyle. They fall in love where he ultimately demonstrates sacrifice while she grows stronger. Predictably her family disapproves of him until they cling to each other during the pointlessly long climax sinking of the ship. DiCaprio and Winslet are basically Romeo and Juliet under different names. Billy Zane is embarrassing as her jealous fianc√© who scowls and pursues them with a gun. Kathy Bates makes an appearance as one of the many doomed passengers. Huge achievement for Cameron but the sinking climax is overlong and sometimes corny as bodies hurl to their deaths leaving many hoping they will not sink with it. Score: 5 ¬Ω / 10",5/10
Titanic - overlong and overrated,Ibuk,6 November 2007,"I may not make myself popular with this statement but I hate Titanic. One reason is that it is far too long for a Hollywood movie. It spends most of its time waffling on and on and on. I went to see it in the cinema when it released it 97, it didn't impress me then it doesn't impress me now. I have liked James Cameron's previous work like Terminator and True lies but he has really disappointed this time around.Now onto the good points. The last scene was so moving and the song My heart will go on is one of my favourites. Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet were very good in their roles. I feel that it should have been made like a documentary rather than a standard 90's disaster movie. On the other hand there are millions of titanic fans and I have been known to have unusual tastes in movies. Go and see it and decide for yourself",2/10

Sweeping epic!,blackwidowis7cool,20 September 2019,"James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic is timeless, moving, and a real visual splendor (though they could brush up on one or two CGI scenes). The attention to detail is stunning and breathtaking. It is perfectly written and perfectly cast - particularly with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose. They both are extremely talented, top-notch actors.
You don't even notice how long it goes for. It grabs you and sucks you in. But it is also sad and a bit depressing knowing what will happen at the end. I haven't cried at a movie in a long time, so was surprised to find myself crying at this movie. I can relate in some respects to Rose and I really like the message about enjoying life.
A strongly recommended movie.",9/10
what was the point of this,angie-27,4 April 1999,"I must admit, as a movie buff, that this was the worst piece of sap-o-rama ever the ""grace"" the screen. I mean, What was the point?  It was about two little spoiled kids running around on some stupid boat saying stuff like ""I'll never let go"". Come on!!  The romantic side of it was so contrived it felt like I was being choked as I watched it.  None of the characters were even half-way decent, and all the actors were just a waste (Leo Dicaprio is a loser) the boat was the main character, and the iceberg was the supporting actor/bad guy.  Towards the end of the movie, I was hoping the boat would just sink already just to put me out of my misery.  When Kate Winslet was threatening to throw herself overboard, I was on the edge of my seat yelling ""Jump! Do it, Jump!""  James Cameron uses the death of a thousand innocent people in an attempt to illicit some emotion out of the audience, since the characters of the movie can't do it.  The only redeeming quality of the whole film was Kathy Bates, but even she couldn't save this boat from sinking.  Let's face it, the only reason there is to watch this movie is if you got a couple of hours to kill and your dentist can't give you a root canal just right now, but you want to prepare yourself for the pain.",1/10

I'm generally a fan of Cameron and normally his writing is very good, but the sub plot to this film was appalling.  Why did Rose, who was meant to be English played by an English actress have a bad American accent.  Why did every Englishman/woman on the boat (which incredibly was an English ship you know, not American as the film tries to push) an evil nasty character.The acting was probably the worst in film history and the love story was so silly and badly done.  All the scenes on the boat looked like Hollywood stage sets.It's very disturbing that a film like this can win Oscar recognition.

The Top of the Pyramid,AttilaD87,30 August 2008,"The movie is a total perfection. When it appeared back in 1997 and i watched for the first time it leaved an influence on me what no other movie had.

That is shame ,this movie it is at least in the top 5 greatest movies ever not too mention in the top 250. A movie at least 8-9 out of 10 ,IMDB USERS!!! Wake Up and see the movie again because you seen something else. I cannot find another top with movies somewhere else where Titanic is not included.The movies prior theme beside the ship's history is the greatest human feeling: love what is universal and timeless. The picture presents us the meaning of true love. Our main characters Jack the poor artist and Rose the rich girl from the first class made us all cry even if we willing too recognize or not.Inn all lines the movie makes us think if we can go further after loosing the the most precious person in our life. We'll we can go on because life must goo on but it will remain in our hearts forever.With no doubt this is the best movie directed by James Cameron, among his other great achievements.

Glug...glug...glug...thunk.,j30bell,21 December 2004,"Just outside Kursk on a sunny July morning in 1943 Obersturmf√ºhrer Muller of the 3rd Panzer Division has a problem. His fancy new Panther tank, in a Meisterst√ºck of environmentally sound engineering, has come with a two live zebra painfully welded to the rear and, as we know, Germans don't do back wheel drive. Vorsprung Durk Technic.A similar, and no less surreal, problem plagues James Cameron's technical tour de force. It is impressive, groundbreaking and sophisticated but, let's face it, it's going nowhere with a plot like that bolted incongruously to its chassis.Renowned to be one of the most expensive films of all time; it seems preposterous that a few quid couldn't have been siphoned from the ""huge-ship-sinks-dramatically"" budget into the ""story"" budget. But there you go.The actors try their best. Plaudits go Leonardo DiCaprio for successfully rehashing Hollywood's cheesy Iorish stereotypes. Billy Zane is excellent as the ""creepy, violent one"". And, of course, our Kate furthers the plot significantly by putting her famous waps on display (they are very impressive).In fact the plot is so bad, and the dialogue so awful, you can sense the huge directorial sigh of relief when the ship starts to sink. Listen carefully and you can almost hear Cameron mutter over tortured screech of ice on metal, ""Ah! This is the kinda film I understand."" Once the ship goes belly-up things do, indeed, liven up dramatically. Things slide around, people scream, chandeliers crash, vast imponderable drops open beneath peoples' legs and the huge, hulking edifice that is James Cameron's Titanic sinks gracefully and inexorably into the dark waters.At least an hour and forty minutes before all this, Winslet provides one of the more amusing, unintentional ironies of the film, when she declares to the ship's designer ""Mr Freud has some interesting theories about men forever striving to make things bigger"". Biggest ship, biggest movie, biggest budget. Hmmm, save it for Oprah.So impressive, expensive, huge and groundbreaking. Nevertheless, Titanic remains a towering cathedral to mediocrity - and the only film for which the best viewing experience is achieved by arriving two-and-a-half hours late and leaving ten minutes before the end. 4/10.",4/10
"Good, Yes¬ÖThe Best¬ÖNah",gigan-92,22 November 2010,"C+ The best grossing film of all time, until recently that is, but is it really the best film ever? Even worthy of getting all that money? Upon initial viewing, many probably thought so, but I'm not one of those. It does have its strong suits, and James Cameron has rarely, if ever, failed me. This film stands out as quite different in tone contrast to say ""Aliens', ""T2', or even ""Avatar"". Note the first two, f*CK Avatar, use low-key lighting, while this film is just so bright all the time. The performances are grade A in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are great throughout , and the end sequence was of course astonishing and a leap forward in visual effects.My biggest problem with this movie? It over does a love story to the point it hits two hours or so, and then we get an hour more or less of epic disaster with tragedy and believable chaos. But the first two hours just seem to drag on, quite unnecessarily at that. Along with that, the score was dismal at best. Naturally the only scene to defy this was the ""last song"" instant as it sank. One of the main things that draws me to a film it its score, or sometimes a lack there of. Sappy romantic themes and an unfitting climax music as thousands drown. It just was distracting and honestly didn't belong there. Overall, ""Titanic"" is worth seeing and all, but far from being the best movie ever, or even close for that matter. This a movie where I definitely rent the DVD, practically fall sleep an hour or so in, then wake up and say ""what the? Still not yet?"", and then just use chapter selection to get to see the climax.",7/10

I know some overly stimulated people love this film for its emotional romantic story and great acting by 'Leo' and 'Kate' I can't help but feel this is less than rubbish. If this deserved best picture and most successful film of all time, I'm sure The Stupids and Godzilla deserved to be in the AFI Top 100 list. This has no meaning at all, and encourages stupid teens to steal girls from their fiances. I mean, who is the villain here if a poor try-hard gambling artist who seduces rich women and goes into a rich man's car and makes it dirty and makes her think not to marry the man she truly loves and wanted to get married with? That's either a very sick surfer-dude or ONE, DUMB woman. When he dies, he only makes it worse for Kate and basically ruins her life. She has no mother, no husband and no life anymore. It was that S.O.B. who made her live with her daughter in a haystack cabin 80 years later, if DiCrapio wasn't there she would have died happily rich and loved by her family.Yes, James Cameron did a good job wasting his time here, he did probably deserve Responsible for the Biggest Mistake Ever, but he did much better in T2, The Abyss, Aliens and True Lies. Those films actually entertained me. And, Jim, you're NOT the king of the world.The script was wonderful. Glorious is all I can say.""I'll never let go Jack, I'll never let go...""

The romantic story overlaying it all lends poignancy and drew in the crowds, in record numbers.  The performances are, by and large, good-to-excellent, except for Leonardo DiCaprio, who did much better in his earlier movies (up to and including The Quick and the Dead), and Billy Zane, who's never been able to do more than look like a movie star.Cameron is a great director of action, and a good visual story teller.  Too bad he's such a control freak, he ought to allow someone to re-write all his dialogue so that it sounds like humans talking, not T-1000's.

great movie!,mattkratz,15 April 2018,"This was an epic movie in every sense of the word. You knew the boat was going to sink, and the movie showed more than that. It showed a human love story amidst it, the lady in it struggling with her jerk of a fiance, good characters, the many historical passengers of the ship (John Jacob Astor, ""the unsinkable"" Molly Brown, etc.), a great cast, and lovely scenery. The sinking scene didn't just show the ship sink in a one-minute scene-it played on for an unforgettable length as panic ensued, Leonardo and Kate rushed through the ship as freezing seawater flooded it and the walls and windows crashed, the band played, people raced for the limited lifeboats, and the boat lifted up and broke in two before finally sinking.

"No ""Night To Remember""",jbirtel,2 July 2002,"Watching 'Titanic' was like having 2 people wrestle with a remote channel changer. Just when the movie becomes (historically) interesting, the other person grabs the remote and switches it to a pedestrian daytime soap opera. Did Kate have to be on hand at every step that led to the sinking? (her and Leo are on the side of the deck where the ice hits, of course, JUST missing them; OH! let's put her next to the Captain when he learns Titanic's fate and lack of life boats). The tragedy was story enough and James Cameron did a brilliant business decision to shove a pre-teen love opera to the foreground so girls could flock to the theater over and over to see Leo alive again and again and again...! Give the channel changer back so we can please continue with the story of the ship. Yes, I heard some crying when Leo sank into the abyss...But no sniveling when the little boy (who Leo tries to rescue before the boy is grabbed away from his panicky father) is swept away by the flooded corridor. So much for crying priorities!!I'm a big Cameron fan! Titanic has left him permanently wealthy. And he's tapped into a genre the same way Lucas tapped with Star Wars in attracting a select category of people that were willing to see this over and over (Titanic's billion dollar revenue was the result of many repeat viewings worldwide combining history with poster boy imagery).Special effects were brilliant! But I'll take the 1958 black and white ""A Night To Remember"" movie instead.Today's lesson: If you're going to use an ax to free someone shackled with chains, don't aim, close your eyes tight, THEN swing hard so you won't see the spraying blood.

Just plain wrong in so many ways,Lady Jasmine,25 March 2002,"I am one of the few people, I think, that has not seen all of Titanic. I saw most of it, and couldn't sit through the rest.You see, I have a great interest in the *real* Titanic. And I truly believe that this three-hour 'epic' is the greatest insult to the tragedy ever to be put on film. It has nothing to do with the ship, or what really happened. The story would have been more realistic set in some city! As it is the ship is just pushed into the background of a love story that could never, and I repeat never, have happened in true life. Rose would never even have met Jack, and most likely she would not have wanted to! Steerage passengers on the Titanic, and all other ocean liners of the time, were strictly prohibited from association with the other classes, and first class held themselves so aloof that they did not even look on second class, let alone steerage, as human beings let alone material for lovers. Rose would have been raised with these attitudes; they would have been engraved in her no matter how 'free-spirited' she was! And what are the chances that a noblewoman, who has likely never done a lick of work in her life, could ever swing an axe without chopping off someone's hand? Nil.This movie is nothing but Hollywood capitalising on a tragedy that cost hundreds of lives. The only really fitting tribute to the doomed liner is Titanic the musical, which has done it's research and is a triumphant tribute to the ship and the world she sailed in, in which the characters become secondary and the doomed liner takes on a life of it's own.",1/10

Marvellous Movie - Excellent 3D Conversion,WinstonNoCGI,2 May 2012,"I just went into the movie theatre to see my all time favourite movie, Titanic by James Cameron, in all its brilliance.It's just like those 15 years have never happened. It's so utterly sweeping to watch this huge vessel rising up in the screen. Cameron outstandingly managed to shoot his sequences comparing sizes against each other which - by their contrast - brings so much emotion to something we only perceive in real life: size.After watching the movie, I can't believe this is a 2D to 3D conversion. This is not just a diorama kind of 3D conversion; watching the movie it's hard to believe it was not shot in 3D originally. Even in real life action scenes Cameron stems the task of creating realistic 3D perspective throughout the movie. It must have been hell to mesh all the fringes in each and every of the frames. Well, as I learned now, it took 60 weeks and 18 Million dollars to work on this. That gamble payed off very well.Not to mention all the emotion that comes with the story. Cameron is a wizard of timing. One moment the audience is just deeply moved by romance, when it gets torn out right the next moment by fear, anger or laugh.This is a very emotional film. There are so many different fates one can as easily think his/her way into. In 1997 I have been crying about what I saw in a movie - I was baffled, because this happened for the first time in my life... Now in 2012 I was crying, laughing, fearing so much all the way again, together with my girl friend.We personally feel so much like Rose and Jack. There are so many details in the movie that match our situation, up to tiny things like dancing barefoot or the butterfly as a symbol for freedom at heart and escape from family's restrictions.To all those who don't like the movie, here's my advice: NEVER watch this film on TV! You can only appreciate this precious work of art in a movie theatre. - I never saw this movie on TV and I never will. But when it'll come back to the theatre's in a couple of years, I'll be right back to watch it there.",10/10
One of the greatest of all time,pensacolacomputer,1 October 2018,"I'm rewatching this now. It has held up very well after all these years. I saw this in the theaters when I was 22. It was just me and my boyfriend who I recently just started seeing. We are no longer together, but I still remember him saying that the way the two were holding each others hands at the bow of the boat, reminded him of the way we touched each other's hands at the time. We were in love, just as Rose and Jack were. This movie also touched home because I too came from money and thought most of the rich people I knew and had dated were uptight and didn't seem to let loose enough and have fun....and I was afraid too I would fall in a trap to it and live a boring existence. It gave me more strength to branch out and not search for someone to love just because of their wealth and status in the world, but instead find love for whats inside a person. My world is better now because of that decision. So I thank you Titanic!",10/10
BEAUTIFUL,cacaxbaca,7 August 2022,I'm 30 years old and probably seen this movie 50+ times. It is beautiful and heartbreaking. It gets better with each watch. I could recite ever word. Absolutely amazing movie. TEARS EVERY TIME.,10/10
Pablum for the brain dead masses.,wbhickok,19 May 2001,"Really, why all the commotion over this movie? This schmaltzy soap opera bubble gum puke is way overlong, with every character some cartoon cliche'. With dialouge so frickin' corny that just made me want to throw a brick through my TV screen. Even at the end, that rotten, stupid cow could have let Leo share the plank she was on, but no, she decides to let him die! What the hell is up with that! When are people going to realize that all the special effects in the world aren't going to compensate for jejune scripts such as this one. It too bad that Cameron didn't line a few bird cages with his script to this manipulative, sugar coated bore-feast, if he would have, it would have put to good use.",1/10

"Oi, Cameron. No.",Covey-3,23 May 2000,"The problem director and writer James Cameron faces with a story about the Titanic is that the majority of his audience will know what happens. So to make his audience care, he switches the action and main plot from the ship, to a socially inappropriate love story between Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater. The trouble is that by incorporating the love story theme into the story, he seems to detract from the feel and humanity that previous Titanic films like A Night to Remember have had. Cameron instead opts for two separate halves to the story rather than melding the two separate elements together. The first half concentrating on building an audience rapour with the two main characters, while the second half concentrates on the special effects fuelled sinking of the doomed liner. This would be forgivable if it weren't for several key factors from the first half, the main weakness being the utterly one dimensional lead characters we are presented with. From Caledon Hockleys loveless millionaire to Rose's trapped innocence to Jack Dawson's poor boy with a dream. Aswell played as these characters are, the performance can't make up for the poorly written characters the actors have been given. Again, with the spectacle of the story of the titanic and the millions of dollars at Cameron's disposal, one could forgive the weakness of the characters, but then the  first half of the story is so entirely clich√© ridden and full of predictability that it becomes obvious. It is clear that she will leave her safe life and existence and go with the unpredictability of true love. It is almost as though Cameron knows how to tell this story visually, he's just not sure or not capable of making you care about it. Cameron's writing has always come under scrutiny. The comic book quality of films like True Lies and the Terminator films set the scene for his writing style. The childlike quality of some of the dialogue shouldn't but does stand out. ""Something Picasso"" and Freud, is he a passenger?"" are so dire that they belong in a Farrelly Brothers film, not a $200 million blockbuster. Cameron does seem to be writing from the heart, the trouble is that his heart doesn't seem up to the task. ""It's pay-day boys"" and Dicaprio's now legendary ""I'm the king of the world"" seem not to be spoken by the characters in the film, but by Cameron himself. He is the master film-maker who can resurrect the Titanic and will make a fortune from it.Questions that arise on investigation of the film closely are the gaping plot hole of  Rose's narration and status as the main narrative agent. If the story we see is told from Rose's perspective, how are we granted access to scenes such as the Captain's death and Hockley and Lovejoy hatching the plan to trap Jack? Again, if the story we are being told is not from Rose's perspective and is a general overview of the events, why are we subjected to Rose's story telling voice over? Perhaps this is being overly critical of what is simply meant to be viewed as popcorn entertainment and indeed, the film isn't entirely without its merits. The hour long sinking of the ship is indeed breathtaking and the film does have probably three genuinely special moments. Winslet and Dicaprio's flying scene, the ship breaking in two and Jack's death which is surprisingly touching and moving. The trouble is, especially in a three hour long film, that these few moments don't make up for the other half of the film. In a three hour film, half is ninety minutes, the average length of a Hollywood film, perhaps Cameron should have sacrificed some of the unnecessary moments and concentrated the story into perhaps just over two hours.Cameron's back catalogue of films should prepare us for what we are going to see. The Abyss, True Lies and Terminator 2 : Judgement Day show that as a visionary, he can amaze his audience simply by clicking his fingers. The problem lies with his misplaced attempts to try and bring humanity into his stories. In The Abyss, Cameron wants us to care about the relationship between Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio and Ed Harris. In True Lies, we are asked to care about Schwarzenegger's flagging relationship with his wife Jamie Lee Curtis. Similarly in Titanic, we are asked to ignore the special effects and care about the characters relationship. If Cameron were to write a out and out blockbuster that did not need characters require the audience to care, he would probably create one of the most amazing films ever to be seen. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be what he wants to do.",No Rating
"Inane Script, Unconvincing Characters",Glaschu,29 August 1999,"Hmm, I wonder what happened at the end? I must have watched 6/8 of this film before washing the dishes seemed a more appealing chore. Many actors can perform convincingly in period films, but this cast did not convince me at all that they were anything but 1990s actors with 1990s dialog trying to look like people from the 1910s. The script was inane, leaving the viewer with only special effects for interest. In the very-near future, when high-tech special effects no longer dazzle audiences, this moneymaking venture will be re-evaluated. I'll give it a 2/10 in order to be fair to the special effects staff, who clearly labored the hardest on this film and deserve some credit.",1/10
Sinking fast...,joliefille411,26 April 2007,"... and yet not nearly fast enough. When this movie first splashed onto the big screen, I was in the middle of the prime target: young, teenaged girls who all too easily swooned over the new ""it"" guy, Leo, and wanted a taste of ""adult"" love. Thank heavens I somehow missed it on that round, only to have one of my friends pull it out nearly a decade (has it really been so long?) later for a girl's night. I was stunned. The hype created by the Oscars and gushing of my peers set this movie on a pinnacle from whence the movie plummeted to the bottom of the ocean to join its namesake. If only they had left the story there. The first TWO HOURS were spent dilly-dallying aimlessly along the ship following Rose,a girl who is deprived a life by her dominating fianc√©e, her conniving mother, and ultimately her own self. She goes back and forth from suicidal to ""equal rights"" to ""you are not of my element"" with schizophrenic dexterity. I have great admiration for Kate Winslet, but this character was gratingly awful to watch. Mr. DiCaprio was little more than a pretty face during the movie. His lack of drive proves him not a knight in shining armor, but meh, he's just not as bad as the villain. And somehow, they fall madly into doomed love because *gasp* the ship is going to sink! So now, the ship has fiiiiinally begun to sink, but wait! You still have another HOUR to watch the main people get stuck, cut to people drowning, oh wait Rose and Jack are safe, cut to more drowning. Oh wait, the ships still sinking, so Rose and Jack aren't safe again, oh they're safe, wait no..... DIE ALREADY! So after three hours, Rose finally says I'll never let go! upon which she immediately lets go and is magically found unfrozen in a colony of frozen solid bodies. Yes, its amazing how it goes.So why 2 stars? I'll chalk it up to the romantic notion behind the ship, which has managed to still fascinate people a century later. The recreation of detail was admittedly stunning, although I got just as much out of a Titanic mystery computer game. Normally, even if I don't care for a movie, I'd say knock yourself out if you still wanna see it, but at 3 painful hours long, I'd definitely go with a no.",2/10
"Infinity rating, Movie that stands till the cinema live",kumarpraneeth,10 February 2023,"Is there something wrong with the humans giving less than 8 or else humans can't feel the emotion of true love.James Cameron is remarkable, visually presented his dawn dream and everyones fantasy in 3hrs. Showed every emotion just like straight from the story we heard.It makes me to dive into the characters and feel the pain of their loses every time I watch it. Not only the agony they went but also the happiness they experienced.James Horner never failed to make sure that we feel in the path of characters do. Never amazed he got the Oscar for what he gave to us.Not expecting anything greater love story than this for the next sixty years.",10/10
Titanic: the parody,Rueiro,11 June 2016,"This film is so full of absurdities and clich√©s that it is to all the previous Titanic films what ""Airplane"" is to the ""Airport"" saga and ""Blazing Saddles"" is to the Western genre. The unhappy high society girl goes down to third-class deck although it is out of bounds for her. She wants to jump overboard, but she is stopped by a happy-go-lucky nobody with no future and with nothing to his name but the clothes he is wearing on. As a reward he is invited by Hockley to dine fist-class with the jet-set so they can make fun of his lack of education and manners. But he gets along without making too much of a fool of himself, and charms everyone around the table but stiff Hockley and Rose's toff horrid mother. But bored to death from so many starched collars, small talk and no being able to scratch his bum,belch or pick his nose, Jack eventually sneaks away with Rose to a merry party down in third-class where one can swear, spit, get plastered on cheap beer, belch, fart and throw up until they fall flat on their faces. The next day a self-confident and jolly Jack enters the out-of-bounds territory of first class again looking for Rose, greets Mr Andrews like and old mate and trots along without being bothered at all. Although he sticks out like a sore thumb no one seems to notice him. Feel yourself at home, laddie, just don't take a leak in the flower vases, that's all. He is only stopped when he tries to disrupt a solemn religious service. That is the only one thing that cannot be tolerated by any means. Randy Rose asks Jack to draw her naked, and he does so while maintaining his coolness and concentrating seriously on his work as she lies there displaying all her jewels. But instead of banging her in the luxurious comfort of her private chamber they go down to the hull???... Meanwhile Hockley the Wally finally realises that his girl is bending over for that miserable third-class gutter rat, and boy, that drives him bananas. Then the ship bumps into an iceberg because the two idiotic sailors on watch duty are far more interested on the antics of the two horny kids rather than on doing the job they are being paid for in the first place. Here we go then: the unsinkable Titanic commences to sink and the movie finally takes off after 90 minutes of utter boredom. Mr Andrews rushes to the officers' room to deliver his diagnosis, and now there comes the most hilarious scene in the film. As Andrews states that the ship is already dead, company president Ismail almost has an apoplexy. You see his face, with his eyes almost popping out, his choking cry of ""But that is impossible! This ship cannot sink!!"" He is babbling in disbelief, his blood pressure rocketing up to the verge of a coronary, spit flying out of his mouth¬Ö And Andrews turns to him -you can almost see his eyes rolling ""I built her, sir. She's made of iron. It can sink, and I assure you it will"" And that shuts Ismail up for good. So, now they've got just two hours to get out of there. First-class people go first, of course, since they are the ones who paid more for being here in the first place. Second-class will go after if still there is time. As to third-class¬Ö well, we just learn now that the lifeboats have a full capacity for only half of the people on board, 700 of which are third-class rubble. Well, officers, you know the procedures: women and children first, and no paupers jumping the queue or you'll be fired. And then, if there is still time and a few empty places left, well¬Ö just chuck a few ragamuffins into the boats and then save yourselves. And good luck. A third-class ticket for the Titanic did cost the equivalent to 1,500 euros in today's money, and a first-class cost 115,000. So you were treated accordingly to what you paid for, as simple as that. Although time is running out Hockley keeps his hair on, confident that he will buy his way out with a thick wad of notes in the last minute, but meanwhile he is about to play his last villainy: accusing poor old Jack of stealing the mother of all diamonds, and to do that he relies on the faithful assistance of his devoted butler. Nasty Lovejoy frames Jack and has him handcuffed deep below so that he will drown quicker. But stubborn Rose, in an almost superhuman feat that will have feminist radicals raving, sets him free, they get back to deck and try to board a boat. The outraged Hockley, now on the verge of an apoplexy,chases them with a gun in a comical sequence that culminates with another ridiculous line ""I put the diamond in the coat and I put the coat on her!"" The ship finally sinks into history, but the pair of randy doves manage to stay afloat. Now, the water is freezing and no one can survive in it for more than half an hour at the most. Yet Jack seems to last for hours long after everyone else floating around have succumbed to hypothermia. But eventually he dies too, because the story was meant to be a tearjerker in the first place. Miraculously enough, Rose, despite wearing her soaking clothes on all night, survives without even getting a cough (!!!)",3/10
I cried....... because I paid.....,Newski_the_Hippie,3 October 2005,"This movie is proof that everything Loyd Kaufman said about Major Studios is right. They force their crap down our throats, remove the art from film-making, and award budgets and names instead of ingenuity and talent.This movie is bad from beginning to end. It's not just that I hate movies that are hyped, this movie is just hard to watch. I want romance, not people saying I love you over and over again. And I want a real couple, not a couple of star crossed lovers pulled out of the average crappy teen drama. And I want, maybe this is too much, to feel for the people who died on the Titanic, not cheer when the ship finally goes down.The special effects were phenomenal. But that does not make the movie great. I never liked the characters. Rich girl and poor artist. So? Why am I supposed to like them? Because they belong together even though they come from different worlds? Give me more then that. Neither of the characters was anything more then an empty shell of a being. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio tried their best but could not pump life into the characters.Many films came out that year. Many great ones. This wins the Oscar why? Do people like movies that are driven only by a tragedy that means nothing because we care nothing about the people? We have a real story. One of the most famous disasters of the 21st Century, the struggle of the people on the ship, and those trying to save them. The people who survived, those who met their demise. We don't need a love story that is completely without love.",1/10
Great film!,mathewazaria,5 September 2018,Great emotional impact held by a sweep-you-off-your-feet epic romance and disaster movie. You can not get any better than this. What really made this movie matter was one thing: it launched the A-list acting careers of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. DiCaprio saw the role's potential when offered it and has had an impressive career since due to his stellar performance here. Winslet campaigned heavily for the role she got it and the same thing happened to her where her stellar performance brought about an impressive career. Give this one a try and see if you like it. I hope you do. Also I hope you can get past the displays of artistic license taken with some of the historical facts. Hope you have fun watching any movie you choose to watch because that's what movies are for. It's the art of entertainment.,10/10
Titanic,lasttimeisaw,3 October 2012,"To admit this is the first time I have watched TITANIC from A to Z might hinder my credibility as a serious film critic (as least a self-acclaimed title), I have had several sketchy viewings during all these years but never conquered it entirely, then all of sudden it occurred to me a few days ago this is the biggest loophole in my filmography which I should mend ASAP, so after the lengthy 3 hour saga, now I could feel calmer in facing the numerous household names still stuck in my to-be-watched list and meanwhile other potential newcomers have never stopped emerging.To be honest with oneself, no one could deny TITANIC is a monumental masterpiece, the visual stunts are so compelling and marvel me in its verisimilitude of reconstructing such a monolith setting (what's more indomitable is the fact that it has survived a 15 year interval which should have been a light-year in the evolution of digital technology, and will still stand out not only among its peers). Also the film is a well-crafted emotional vehicle of a catastrophe depicting in an impeccable way to render immaculate empathy towards its audience as if we were literally heading towards our own doomsday (I did redden my eyes when the valedictory score was accompanying the final farewell). The love story of Jack and Rose, although being a bit predictable and the black or white of the character development is somewhat perfunctory given the ample running time it has, could universally strike a chord in any corner of the world, DiCaprio and Winslet have generated unparalleled chemistry on screen (especially for Kate, since she has a more narrative arc to accomplish). Billy Zane, whose past 15 years has testified that he could never outshine this tailor-made character. Gloria Stuart and Katy Bates are both in my top 10 list of the supporting category, and since I'm re-watching DOWNTON ABBEY these days, whose correlation with TITANIC has suggested that all the first-class passengers don't need to change any outfit to be grafted into the red-hot show, maybe Katy Bates could reprise her role as the survival of the calamity, Julian Fellowes might give it a shot. To be the all-time highest grossing film in North America, and the runner-up if put under the international parameter (after Cameron's own brooding AVATOR 2009, 9/10), TITANIC has every reason to be loved by the majority of the mass, and it may not be among the top- tier darling among orthodox film critics, but will remain as a tenacious one in my list. Another afterthought is that I hope AVATOR will look as fabulous as TITANIC now when 2024 eventually arrives.",9/10

Not As Good As I Was Hoping,Rainey-Dawn,25 June 2014,"Titanic was not as good as I was hoping it to be.... I was disappointed in the film. I want to like this film because Leonardo DiCaprio is in the film because I like him - he's a great actor! But I could not get past the fictional romance the movie was focused on. I was hoping for more of a documentary type of a film but, alas, it was not so.The casting and acting was quite good! The set was realistic as well. There are good moments in the movie so I can't knock it completely.IDK, maybe I will have to be alone and in a romantic mood to enjoy this movie more than I actually did the first couple times I viewed it. Or, maybe, I really did want a modern documentary type of movie on The Titanic.I hate to dislike this film but I do. It's a movie I should at least like better than I do but I do not. I have to rate the film low due to the fictional romance the film was focused on.6/10",6/10
"Yes, I think this is a GREAT film",stevenfallonnyc,21 December 2003,"""Titanic""....this movie on the surface would normally strike fear into the hearts of film fans like myself, who usually despise most typical mainstream drivel. While I am a huge film fan, I rarely go to the movies in theaters anymore because everything just looks so BAD. The last film I have seen in theaters was actually ""Spider-Man,"" a great film marred by the horrible cartoonish special effects.My tastes in film vary greatly...I love the classics (Cagney, Bogie, etc), romance, B-flicks, Godzilla films, car chases, superhero stuff and much more. However, almost all the films I like were made before the 90's, when film started to get REALLY bad. I also love to observe a good phenomenon - whoch ""Titanic"" became almost instantly.I read all about ""Titanic"" before it was released, how the budget went up to a staggering $200 million making the film a tremendous gamble. When it was released in late '97, it did very good but not great numbers - but the word of mouth on this film was unlike anything seen since Star Wars probably - the box office take remained steady for a LONG time. As weeks went by, it actually earned more and more, and the phenomenon had started.Then in late 1998, when the film was still playing some theaters almost a year later, and for a whole year we've heard how unbelievable ""Titanic"" was and how Leo was adored by girls all over the world and how hot Kate was - I finally kicked in 2 bucks at a discount theater to see what all the fuss was finally about. Alone (in a packed theater) as not to be distracted by a friend, I got my snick snacks, found my seat, and watched with a completely open mind.Three hours later, I, who again hates virtually everything mainstream these days, said to myself, that was one of the greatest films I had ever seen.Many say ""Titanic"" is ""fomulatic,"" ""typical Hollywood drivel,"" and the famous, ""...but we know the ending, the ship sinks."" I say, ""Titanic"" was an extremely rare present-day excursion in old-school grandiose film-making. Huge sets were built as opposed to having everything drawn with computer effects. It was a great romantic story, which the audience was compelled to feel for, especially having the knowledge ahead of time that it would be doomed (""the ship sinks""). It had great drama, great music (even the one song I can stand hearing Celine Dion sing), and a lot of heart from James Cameron who, love him or hate him, showed amazing dedication to getting his epic on screen.And say whatever you want about Leonardo DiCaprio - he was excellent in Titanic and is one of the very best actors out there right now.Anyone who has read some of my other reviews would know that I hate computer effects. But the CGI in ""Titanic"" is the one instance where they actually do work a little, because they do not overtake the picture and aren't the focus. It definitely is not the same as watching a cartoon Spider-Man battle a cartoon Green Goblin in a film that is not supposed to be a cartoon.""Titanic,"" dare I say, is the ""Gone With The Wind"" of our time. it's a huge movie, a blood, sweat and tears movie, a movie with some real elbow grease behind it. And never boring for a second.""Titanic"" is arguably the best film of the 90's (only ""Goodfellas"" gives it a run for that title in my opinion), and is probably one of the greatest 40 films ever made. Now that may be a surprising thing for me to say given I am such a huge fan of the classics, but however rare it may be, there are extremely rare instances when something new is in the same league as something classic.One last note - it is surprising that this film has such a bare-bones DVD out. While there are rumors that a ""special edition"" DVD is in the works, the present DVD is a disappointment with no extras at all. Considering this movie at three hours long had two hours CUT from it alone would make some good extras in deleted scenes. Add on the commentaries, a few ""makings of"" and add on a bunch of other crap and you have got a killer, proper DVD release for ""Titanic.""",10/10
Overlong but entertaining movie with brilliant production values,snoozejonc,8 May 2023,"The one and only voyage of the RMS Titanic.The detail of the ship and depiction of the main event is astonishing from a technical perspective and contains the kind of action-suspense that you would expect from a James Cameron movie. It holds up to modern standards and in 1997 it was state of the art spectacle.Whether or not you fully appreciate the story depends on how invested you are in the romance and central characters. I think Rose is the most interesting, as she is trapped in a difficult situation that you want to see her escape. Jack for me is too perfect to be plausible and feels like a fantasy creation from the pen of a Hollywood writer. However, both are well played by two charismatic leads. The weakest character is the antagonist. Billy Zane does a good job, but the character is written so one-note he is cartoonish in his villainy. Generally, the love triangle is simplistically portrayed in a way that suggests the filmmakers do not wish to tax audiences.In my opinion it is longer than it needs to be and this is down to the flashback element. If Cameron had excised all scenes of underwater exploration and those of a certain character reflecting on the past to narrate the story it would be much less of a slog. Considering there is so much fiction involved there is no need to spend so much time making it feel like a historical reconstruction.",8/10
Phenomenal Film. Just Wonderful,foxhound-37781,28 March 2017,"One of my biggest childhood memories was seeing Titanic in the theatre. I was only 7 years old when it was first released and I had no idea what a hell of a ride I was in for. My father always had a keen interest in the Titanic and its sinking, and I remember a large Atlas like book he had of the Titanic full of pictures of the wreckage, the dive teams efforts, salvage operations, etc.It was just after Christmas 1997. We went to my grandparents for a weeks holiday. During our visit, the adults decided we were all going to go and see Titanic. So we arrive at the cinema, walk in through the front entrance and there's a line-up like you can't even imagine. a huge line-up, of people, all hoping to get in and see Titanic. we stood in line for a few minutes until an usher came and yelled out ""ALL THOSE WANTING TO SEE TITANIC, TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR TODAY!"", and I think that was my first inkling of ""wow this movie really is a big deal"", So dad went to the ticket booth and got us tickets for two days later, in a 3pm session that had enough tickets left for all five of us.Fast forward two days, we go in and get our seats for the 3pm session, the cinema is jam packed, i'm talking not one seat free. three incredible hours later, we walk out of the theatre, walk back through the shopping centre and get in our 4WD to drive back to nan and pops. The second I got in the car, I was just totally mesmerized the entire way home, thinking about this movie and constantly repeating wow, wow wow, inside my head. As a seven year old kid, Seeing this, all I can say this movie had me gobsmacked.Anyway, onto the movie...A 101 year old woman Rose sees a drawing of a young nude teenager on TV that was recovered from the wreckage, she quickly realizes the nude girl in the drawing is in fact her. She gets into contact with Brock Lovett (played effortlessly by Bill Paxton), who conducts frequent dive and salvage operations of the Titanic's wreckage. He is searching for a lost treasure known as the Heart of the Ocean which is an extremely rare and insanely valuable diamond. After a very disappointing failed salvage attempt, Rose and Brock come into contact and Rose is flown out to their salvage boat, Where rose ends up telling a group (including her granddaughter, Lizzy) her entire story on the Titanic from start to finish.Her story begins with Her arriving in Southampton with her mother, fianc√©, Cal (played wonderfully by Billy Zane), and Mr Lovejoy (David Warner), who kind of acts like family security. We are introduced to a young and very beautiful Kate Winslet. The Titanic is still docked and the docks are crowded with avid passengers and enthusiastic spectators, all itching to see the Titanic set off on its maiden voyage. We are introduced to the handsome and mischievous Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his friend Fabrizzio in a tense poker game. They're lucky enough to win tickets on board and merely make it on board.The next portion of the film has various characters talking about the Titanic's construction, kind of as a way to feed the audience some background knowledge I guess. We're introduced to the ship's owner, builder and a whole array of other first and third class citizens. After Rose explains how depressed she was starting to feel after being caught up in the madness of being a first class citizen, and being forced to marry someone she denies her love for, we see Rose upset and about to jump off the ship committing suicide. Here, we have a lovely and eerily quiet introduction between Rose and Jack. For assisting Rose, Her fianc√© cal, invites him to dinner in first class the following evening. We see the clear distinction between Third and first class. Jack has no idea how to behave like a first class citizen, and portrays that very nicely on screen to the point where it's actually quite humorous. Later on in the film, after a few more dramas, we see what I can only describe as the most Iconic and memorable on scree kiss, of any movie in history. Now we come to the part of the film we came to see. The sinking. The remainder of the film is pure epic. We see the ship slowly sinking, more water rushing through the various floors and decks, the passengers becoming progressively more panicked, The captain trapping himself in the wheel house, people turning on each other, distressed children and parents, people jumping off the ship into the freezing ocean trying to survive and it's incredible how much you do actually feel like you're there on the ship. All of it was done in studios but it literally does look like its sinking into a real ocean. And the scene where the ship splits in two, was the icing on the cake for me. After the ship has sunk, the survivors floating in the ocean become slowly more and more quiet, until there's complete silence. I still to this day find it a very eerie and disturbing part of the film. All in all, Titanic is quite simply put, just a ground breaking piece of cinema. The film makers got the Era spot on in terms of clothing and how characters look and behave, and as I understand got the look of the Titanic's interior spot on for the time period too. It really does feel like you're back in 1912, and it's always a movie I can come back to every few years and enjoy it as if it was my first time seeing it as a 7 year old. Phenomenal film. 10 out of 10. Fox.",No Rating
"thank god they all die, mostly",fukko123,20 March 2002,"The featured review of this film carries the line ""the scene shifts to Southampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912"" A minor point perhaps, to our american friends but Southampton is in England. Still, i only partly put that glaring error down to the unfortunate american who wrote it. After seeing Titanic i would have got the impression Southampton is in Ireland too. The ship was built in Belfast which was British then and is British now, so to make up for that and appease the Irish American audience they fill the ship with poor unfortunates from the emerald isle whose only role in the film seems to be getting screwed by the English ""tyrants"" who run the ship. Add a few poor but heroic Americans to the mix and you've got a blockbuster. To be fair, i hate this type of film anyway so it was never going to get a good review from me. 2 / 10",1/10
Titanically Awful,didi-5,11 February 2004,"'Titanic' looked so promising, but personally I would say it is the worst film ever made.  Not only does it lay aside any consideration of real stories that happened on the ship, but it constructs a piece of ridiculous class-divide mush instead!Leonardo di Caprio (excellent in Romeo + Juliet) and Kate Winslet fail to convince as Jack and Rose, a boy from steerage and a girl from first class. And Billy Zane was downright embarrassing as Rose's stuck-up fiance.  There were some good performances - Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Bernard Hill as Captain Smith, even Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose - but they are few and far between.The biggest problem I had with the film though was the god-awful script and scenes.  Corny lines ('as we walk through the valley of death'/'could you walk a little faster?').  The scene in the car where the windows mist up just at the crucial moment.  The ridiculous pose at the head of the ship. And perhaps worst of all, the clean water and the fact that Winslet keeps travelling in the lift - downwards - as the ship floods.Watching 'Titanic' for me was a total waste of over 3 hours and an excruciating experience.  May I never have the misfortune to see even a minute of it again.",2/10
Monumental Waste,aramis-112-804880,6 June 2018,"The real history of ""Titanic"" (some of which is touched on in this mess) is a compelling story. While this flick might be ""Romeo and Juliet"" at sea, I found the whole shebang was at sea.The good thing is, ""Titanic"" is full of fine actors. From David Warner to Bernard Fox, right through Jonathan Hyde and even soap star Eric Braeden. The bad thing is, we don't see enough of them.What we get is an awful lot of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. If either of those two (if you'll pardon the pun) ""float your boat"" then you're on easy street. I can't stand either of them and unfortunately what should have been a mawkish subplot is the mawkish major storyline (the ""Trivia"" item that Leonardo's part was offered to Johnny Depp and he declined practically broke my heart). I tried making it through this gargantuan waste of celluloid with the lovers; then I tried fast forwarding through scenes of those two infernal bores . . . and realized I was losing nearly all the movie. There was no escaping them!The movie's major flaw (apart from casting those two simps as the leads) is that the major part of the movie, set in 1912, doesn't really gel with the ""modern"" scenes. Furthermore, not for a moment did I buy Gloria Stuart as an older Kate Winslet. I assume that idea, which was presented up front and so isn't a spoiler, was carried on through the movie. I don't know because I was simply unable to finish watching ""Titanic."" It was BORING. Fortunately I was watching on VHS tapes I picked up for free at a book sale. It was on two tapes and I never bothered putting the second one in. I suppose that's where all the real drama and big effects come in, but the first half was so tedious I saw no reason to bother with the rest. After all, I know what happened to the ship in the end, though I won't reveal it here.It's too bad because I was something of a ""Titanic"" buff in high school. Therefore, I was able to spot little historical errors. I also hate historical movies and tv shows where some familiar actor is introduced briefly as a real person and then the fictional (i.e., phony) story rolls on--in this case, the affair between Leonardo and Kate.Perhaps it's a curse, but no really good movie has been made about ""Titanic."" the one with Clifton Webb was too soap operaish and had a silly ending. The one with Kenneth More tried to be fairly accurate with information known at the time (now all blown to bits by the discovery of the ship itself). This one is not really about ""Titanic."" It's about the love story, and is worthy of any 1970s disaster movie. It could be set on the Poseidon, in a Towering Inferno, or on Krakatoa. All I know is, it seemed to go on and on and on until little bits of me started dropping off. If I'd been on ""Titanic"" with those two I'd have gone down with the ship.Perhaps people were drawn to this the same way they were to the practically endless ""Doctor Zhivago"" in the 1960s, for a fiery love story (at that time) set against a great historical backdrop. Too bad Omar Sharif wasn't the lover in this one. At least he's always been good for a few laughs. But Kate Winslet is no Julie Christie. And why should she be? She was bad enough in ""Hamlet.""Overall, this must be the most overrated monster in the history of the talkies. It was supposed to be about the tragedy of ""Titanic"" with all its needlessly lost lives, yet I was reminded of the line of Oscar Wilde about a work of Dickens: ""One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell without laughing."" But ""Titanic"" doesn't even have enough hoots in it to make it as watchable as ""Plan Nine from Outer Space."" Just because something is popular doesn't make it good.",3/10
"Truly a classic. Must-watch! 7.7 is a very low rating, it deserves more!",nanda_tapias,28 February 2015,"The work done off screen was completely worth it. I suggest you check the trivia of the movie to understand that this movie deserves all the Oscars it got and more. It is a timeless movie, with strong acting. I've heard people complain bout the acting of the main actors, but without strong acting the movie would have never succeeded as much as it did. Leonardo DiCaprio was born for the role of Jack Dawson, he makes the audience fall in love with him rapidly, and not just because of his looks. Kate Winslet represents well the role of a young girl in need of freedom. Everything about the movie was outstanding. The setting is a very similar replica too the actual RMS Titanic. It is very realistic since several characters did in fact exist. The special effect are great, seeing in 3D must be quite the experience. The music, My Heart Will Go On, also one of my favorite songs. I don't believe there is anything bad to say other than ""Why did Jack have to die? couldn't they write a happy ending? why make people sad when you have the power to make them cry of joy instead? I love you Jack! Rose don't let go of Jack!"" Once you overcome the extreme feeling of sadness and anger because Jack was too nice and died, you realize that the movie is amazing. PERFECT in every sense of the word.",10/10
Why so low rate?,asifuzzamanabirasmr,19 March 2021,"Not a single thing on thia movie is bad. I repeat not a single thing.

"Spectacular, but with lots of flaws",dfle3,4 July 2008,"After seeing this movie years ago at the cinema I thought it was one of the worst movies of all time (as far as major studio pictures go). Thinking about it before posting up a review here, maybe I was a bit too harsh.In short, this story is a fictional tale of two star-crossed lovers on board a real life, famous ship (the ""Titanic"") that sank, killing a great percentage of its passengers and crew (um, sorry if that is a spoiler, but sheesh, you SHOULD know that!).When I am feeling particularly unkind about this film, some of my criticisms are: only director James Cameron could look at the story of the Titanic and think ""Hmmm. That story could make a good movie...IF ONLY IT HAD MORE DRAMA!"". Yeah, sinking ship, hundreds dead, needs MORE drama!Another peeve about this movie is how Cameron can't resist manipulating our sympathies to characters by resorting to melodrama and crudely drawn characters who we find easy to hate, in order to have us rooting for other characters. E.g. Billy Zane's character of Hockley. Didn't quite throw a chihuahua into the ice-cold ocean, but nasty enough to do everything short of this. Really, a more sophisticated script could have made him a figure deserving of our sympathy too.A minor peeve is how one of those star crossed lovers, Kate Winslet's Rose, is quite prescient and insightful about the ship's situation...just didn't seem very plausible for one so young and unschooled in such matters.Despite thinking this movie one of the all time stinkers (for a major studio release) I did, at the time, think it a master-stroke to have the two star-crossed lovers at the centre of this tale (Kate Winslet's ""Rose"" and Leonardo DiCaprio's ""Jack""). It is just a brilliant device in order to hook you and reel you into this great historical drama/tragedy. Again, it was a great pity that Cameron chose not to make a victim of people like Hockley as well, instead of demonising him. And it's not as if Cameron didn't have alternatives in his own script. For instance, Jack's sketching of Rose could have provided a more believable foundation on which to base a relationship on instead of the hysterical melodrama Cameron resorts to to get them together.Perhaps the time-frame of the sinking made melodrama necessary.Truly spectacular but deserved Razzies for things like script and direction.Despite my criticisms, when Titanic eventually hits the ice-berg, the movie is an absolute thrill ride and quite exhilarating.P.S. must put in a word for the great Australian song by Flash and the Pan ""Down among the dead men"". It's not in this movie (Celine Dion does the theme song), but the Flash and the Pan song is actually about the Titanic and is a brilliant pop song...beautiful too. Look it up on You Tube.",4/10
"Great cinematography, even greater hype",perica-43151,20 July 2018,"This Hollywood tour de force is too mainstream for its own good. Great visuals, expensive sets, great hype, but ultimately shallow, it perhaps does not deserve all the hate if often gets, but by all means it did not deserve the hype with which it was initially met. So, in reality, a mixed bag. Hollywood has produced much worse and also had its honor pieces. This moneymaker is neither of the extremes, but it is certainly too soulless manipulative and shallow to be considered a master piece, but when stripped off its dumbest pandering it has some decent side to it, mainly of the technical nature.",4/10

Very good,Med-Jasta,29 January 2020,"I haven't seen this in a very long time. I have always been a fan. Looking back on it now it's not as good as it was then, but still very good. There are a million little dumb things that bother me but they're not real complaints. And maybe this is from seeing the movie so many times. I can tell you exactly where the first VHS cut off.The only real complaint I have is the modern day scenes, this whole story line doesn't need to be there. This is a long movie already and about a half an hour goes into this story that ultimately doesn't matter at all. I found myself not giving a crap about these scenes and just waiting to go onto the ship. And then when they come back saying, ""Oh yeah."" And not caring.And this story line really doesn't mean anything because she has the diamond the whole time and doesn't tell them, for some reason, throws it into the water, for some reason and then dies I'm assuming, for some reason. So having Rose tell the story in modern times doesn't amount to anything. The only thing about showing Rose older is to show that she lived a good life like Jack wanted but they don't really go onto that all that much.The best thing this movie does is make you feel for the people who were actually on the ship and do justice to what they went through. And does a really good job of including real people without making anyone look bad. You even see where the people who made bad decisions were coming from.",8/10
The most OVERRATED film of all time along with Gone With The Wind!,TheMovieeGuy,16 October 2001,"I cannot for the love of God, believe how extremely OVERRATED James 
 Cameron's pile of garbage known as Titanic is! This film, which should 
 have been about the actual sinking of the great luxary ship Titanic, 
 instead relies on a 90210 idiotic love story to ""carry"" the picture 
 through. IF the two main characters had been interesting, it might have 
 been a better picture, but, alas, the two leads, Jack Dawson, and Rose 
 Bukater are about as interesting as watching paint dry. Rose isn't 
 suffering from oppression, she's suffering from SPOILED BRAT syndrome! 
 Jack comes along like a teenage pretty boy rather than a compelling 
 character that the audience relates to.
 
 The film does have a few assets such as costume design, and some of the 
 special effects are pretty good. However, it's the whole script and 
 it's 90210 meets the Titanic setting that makes this the most OVERRATED 
 film in the history of motion pictures! This film grossed $600 million 
 in the United States?!?! James Cameron must have put mind altering 
 drugs into the prints of the film to hypnotize movie audiences and 
 academy members who gave this stinker Best Picture of 1997 over the

An apotheosis of cheese,BlancheDeLaForce,19 February 2002,"I am not as much offended by this movie because of its historical inaccuracy. It is true that for all the hype about how the china, carpeting and furniture reproduced exactly those of the Titanic, and how the ship sunk exactly in the way described by the movie, and so on, the plot is entirely fictitious and proud of it. In itself that is not bad, what's bad is how cheesy and clich√© this plot is, and that this cheesy, clich√© and invented story occupies 90% of the movie's attention, with the sinking of the ship treated as something on the side. The only important people are the main couple, Jack and Rose, her fianc√© and her mother. The remaining characters are treated with a disinterest that borders on disrespect. We only get to know that the third-class passengers are fun-loving and warm, and those in first-class are stuffy, snobbish and exceedingly preoccupied with dinner cutlery. Wow, isn't that new! The whole thing is so fake, it was really difficult to get minimally interested.This movie is the triumph of Hollywood's latest formula, followed also by `Armageddon' and `Pearl Harbor': some action for the boys, romance for the girls, everybody happy (though from the comments I've read here from boyfriends dragged kicking and screaming to see it, maybe I'm wrong about everybody being happy). In the case of Titanic it worked: Leo's fans went to see the movie over and over again, sending its box-office gains into the stratosphere. Truth to tell, it is too much to ask of a megazillion-budget movie like this to be anything but clich√©: it just had to be meretriciously agreeable for the largest possible number of people, so anything adventurous, minimally controversial or profound was out of the question.
But, as I said, so many people liked it, so, what do I know? However, if you are interested in seeing something really related to the Titanic, watch the British movie `A Night to Remember.' The special effects are not so cool, and it is in black and white, but it is far more accurate and infinitely more dignified.",No Rating

Movie which touched the core of my heart !!!!!!!,loopmyworld,29 May 2012,"The movie opens as researchers try to find out diamonds inside the wreck of the real titanic, which gives us the first full look of the wreck of the unsinkable ship which was a bit emotional. Bill Paxton finds 85 years old diary which hold the drawing of the naked women & then later on it's been telecast on TV. The movie goes into flashback & here comes the glimpse of the beautiful ship titanic. The bunch of characters appear in the movie at the port of Belfast, which also includes the male leading start Leonardo winning the ticket of titanic on the lucky hand of poker. The movie literally gives you the feeling of viewer being inside of the ship & according to the facts everything in the movie is been re-designed from the furniture to the decks, lamps, the door way, life boats, & along with the engine room.The real movie beings after Rose decides to suicide jumping from the rear end of the ship & Jack take her mind off the track & saves her. As the movie continues Jack & Rose starts to meet up regularly at the different parts of the ship, while on the other hand Rose mother & her fianc√© Cal doesn't like Rose spending time with lower class standard jack, but still young hearts were attracted to each other. The best scene in the movie according to me is the flying scene of Jack & Rose, which makes rose realize that she is in love with Jack too. The movie takes sudden turns when on the same night titanic hits the iceberg, which in short left my eyes wide open, as it has been directed & executed very well, & then the final chapter of the maiden voyage beings the sinking of the unsinkable titanic. The final hour of the movie filled with reality & the disaster which people till now hasn't forgotten. People struggling to survive & the real history how traveler's were saved into the life boats are the key scenes of the movie. Some true scenes like the Creator of titanic Thomas Andrews died while standing near the dining clock & was last seen, the steamer falling on the jacks brother, third class traveler's were treated during the sinking scenes. The breaking apart of ship are the most shattering scenes in the movie. There is no doubt even today in 2012 still I wonder what James Cameron has achieved in the special effects put into this movie, the year 1997 the worked on their best special effects effort to keep this movie alive even for the upcoming generation to watch on. The soul of the movie is the background score of this motion picture which is composed by James Horner every piece of music is been composed specially to suit the scenes of this movie itself, from the opening sequence to de-porting of titanic to Rose theme & the sinking sequence. James Cameron specially recorded the score of the movie with real orchestra the team of James Horner. In one the interviews of the making of Avatar one of the viewer asked him "" what if you get a chance to direct Titanic again, what would be your experience in making it "" ?? and he answer if I would have been given a change to direct titanic again, I will finish titanic within a month very easily cause of hugely availability of special effects team, cause for titanic I had to wait for some shot for days. For example the shot of Rose & Jack on the front end of the ship kissing each other, he had to wait for days to get proper sunset in the camera as special effects that time weren't that advanced like how they are today. In one word you're a legend Cameron. The wreck shot of ship were taken in the year 1995 2 years before the releasing the movie into theaters. Till now whenever I watch this movie I still feel I'm watching it for the first time & somewhere there are tears in my eyes specially in the scene where rose steps into the life boats & Jacks watches her going away, oh geez that particular scene gets tears in my eyes every time. I am now waiting for the special edition of this movie to be released in 3d blu-ray. True facts about TITANIC Titanic was constructed to be unsinkable ship of that time, but the creator of the ship Thomas made 3 biggest mistakes in constructing the ship. The propeller of the ship were taken directly from the design of the 18's century cruise liner, the water tight compartments had one the major flaws which over flowed the water from the upper decks, the propellers turning radius was not designed to turn ship quickly as the ship size was way bigger than the propellers could bear it during the full stern. On the night of sinking titanic received 5 iceberg warning, but still they ignored the warning & continue sailing. The final decision by the Mr Murdoch to reverse the engines & turning the ship to evade iceberg. The decision not to carry enough life boats cause it ruins the overall look of the top deck & it was initially decided to carry just 8 life boats, but later on more 12 boats were added. The distress call from titanic was actually received by the local streamer waiting for the morning to sail again couldn't reach for help as the streamer couldn't see the titanic as the sky was full of twinkling stars which interrupted the them to see through binoculars.The crew lost their binoculars on the night ship hitted the iceberg.My rating ‚Äì 10/10 !!!!!!!",10/10
Filmmaking on the Grandest Scale,dandare4479,13 April 2017,"James Cameron does not do small films, even his breakout film The Terminator was hitting way above its budget. This is down to Cameron himself and his extreme work ethic to get the money right up there on the screen. This film often gets poor reviews from people, mainly due to its immense commercial success. However this success is truly deserving. There is no other film maker out there who can produce a film on this kind of scale and still pull it off. I was lucky enough to see it at the cinema in 1997. Straight off to even consider diving to the Titanic wreck itself to film it for the movie would be considered insane, Cameron did it 12 times. The film was pitched as Romeo and Juliet on Titanic and Cameron immediately got funded. The film ran massively over budget and there was huge concern at the time that the whole project would implode. However Cameron knew he was onto something special, creating a stunning replica of the Titanic itself, along with exact decor and furniture, props, clothing, even tableware. Cameron cast Romeo himself from the 1996 film Romeo and Juliet, Leonardo Di Caprio. This was a masterstroke as Di Caprio was gaining unrivalled stardom after the 1996 film. Kate Winslet is fantastic as Rose, as a young actress to have that level of scale all resting on your performance to make it all come to life, she pulled it off amazingly and often does not get the credit she deserves. The real star of the show though is the ship itself and its master film director James Cameron. When the ship starts sinking and Cameron moves into his action mode, there is no-one better in the world at pacing action them Cameron, he is a master of suspense at the exact right moments. He is an exceptional story teller and fully deserved all the accolades he has acquired. I highly recommend Titanic and encourage you to watch it on the largest screen possible, films like this do not come along often. The 3d Blu ray is also exceptional and shows what can be done when a 2d film is converted in the right hands into 3d.",10/10

It blends fact and fiction so well in a way that you rarely ever see on film. Movies like this are very easy to make, but there's very hard to make well and almost impossible to make great. It is also probably the most emotional moving film I've ever seen. It's the only movie that made me genuinely cry. It also has one of the important life morals: only life is priceless and making each day count. Although, I do have to admit that the dialogue is predictable and at times stilted.

James Cameron's worst-- though that's not too bad.,du_man,7 June 2003,"Rating: * * 1/2
James Cameron is one of the best film directors out there.  He made ""The Terminator"" in 1984, which is not only Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film, but quite simply the greatest action film ever made.  ""Aliens"" and ""The Abyss"" were excellent sci-fi films and literally invented new technology.  ""Terminator 2"" was a great sequel, and ""True Lies"" was a ton of fun.  He also made T2-3D, a cool theme park attraction.Then he made ""Titanic.""  ""T2"" was the most expensive film of its time at a hundred million dollars.  Titanic more than doubled that.  It went far over budget, in fact.  And it was well spent.  The special effects are absolutely incredible.Cameron's script, however, leaves something to be desired.  It concerns unsatisfied 1st class 16-year-old Rose (Kate Capshaw) and her romance with 3rd class con guy Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio).  His profession: wander around Paris, France drawing girls naked.  Here is problem #1.
(WARNING: minor but predictable spoiler)  In 1912, a 1st class teenaged girl sleeps with a 3rd class teen 24 hours after they meet.  Maybe, *maybe* in the  80s, but in 1912?In fact, that's the main problem.  The film revolves around a romance that is stupid and completely unbelievable.  In other words, the script stinks.The film lasts over three hours.  This is not necessarily a bad thing. All of Sergio Leone's classics last about that long.  But in Titanic, the hours are divided up in different qualities.  The first hour is fine and somewhat spectacular but not great.  The second is really stupid and ruins the film.  The last hour is superb in nearly every way.  As I have already mentioned, the special effects are awesome, and Cameron's directing abilities are at their very best.The cast is fine but not great.  I've never been much of a fan of DiCaprio, but he's okay here.  Capshaw is really good, but is outdone by Billy Zane as her slimy fiancee.This won eleven Academy Awards, which has only been done once before, for 1959's ""Ben Hur.""  Ben Hur was a true classic, and deserved it.Titanic won Best Picture, which should have gone to LA Confidential. Best Director was more or less deserved for helming something on this scale. The special effects, sets, cinematography, costumes, etc. definitely deserved it.  James Horner's score was good, but it did not deserve and Oscar as much as some of his others, like Glory and Star Trek II.  And surely this wasn't the best film song of the year.As I said in the one-line-summary, it is Cameron's worst so far... but that's not really that bad.  Steven Spielburg has made worse than this.It might not be a bad idea to see this film just for the spectacle. I just can't think of any other reason.",10/10
Only to be Idolized by Starry Eyed Tweens,MovieDude1893,25 July 2007,"Titanic {dir. James Cameron, 1997} (*¬Ω/****)Somewhere on its way to becoming the all time box office champion and biggest Oscar winner of all time, James Cameron's Titanic etched out a place in my mind as the one film that can most easily send me into a frenzied rant against the dangers of big- budget, epic film making. Sure, I might not have put it that way when I first saw it (I was seven) but, upon first viewing I knew that this film was nothing special. Four years later, I was able to identify it as simply money thrown onto the screen with little room left for intelligence, emotion or character. Yet even as I professed the evils of this production and its vapid screenplay (penned by director Cameron), there were those who maintained that Titanic was an achievement. Among those people are esteemed film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert , both of whom included it on their top ten lists of 1997. Those celebratory citations led me to revisit Titanic again recently, for the first time on DVD, a disc which preserves the film's original aspect ratio and presents the clearest available picture and sound. The Verdict: As the old truism goes, ""You can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig.""The film isn't all bad; the cast is solid (considering the material..but more on that later), the score is rich, the cinematography is evocative and the production design and visual effects are impeccable. Yet as it turns out, all these elements do not a great film make. Titanic's greatest weakness lies at its very core: the screenplay. It reaches a level so wretched that I will be blunt in my metaphoric criticism. Cameron's script isn't just a turd, it is a floater; it refuses to just be flushed away to haunt us no longer. It insists on having an epic length and employing a framing device that may very well be the cause of a sudden onset of narcolepsy. I'm sorry to resort to such infantile comparison, but I believe that is best to convey the utter insult that is Cameron's screenplay. I consider myself a romantic, yet the so-called romance of this film left me cold, with nothing to do except roll my eyes. The film lacks any new vision or originality, and that can never be commended. I'm fed up at this point; three viewing, each one revealing an un-plundered area of Cameron's incompetence.

"Shame, shame, shame on you, James Cameron",n-mo,21 July 2007,"I will not accuse this of being the most over-rated film I've yet seen, because, first, it has its share of redeeming qualities, and second, that honor has to go to The Illusionist (which in many ways was actually a lame attempt to ape the Titanic formula, but I've already blasted that one into the ground). Neither can I fault it for grossing so much: a film that shamelessly panders to over-emoted teenage girls is bound to produce a good showing at the box-office. But the fact that a sloppy period piece that insults the period it pays tribute to could earn such lavish sycophantic adulation from nearly all reviewers (especially celebrity film writers) is just more evidence that America's thought-√©lite¬ójournalists, politicians, and academics alike¬óhave got to be the most degenerate, gullible, and monolithic in the Western world.There are two intertwined reasons why Titanic is on balance worth seeing: the historical setting and the special effects. Enough has been written on the latter, and on the former, as well, but as an Atlantic historian I cannot express enough love for anything so exquisitely and meticulously designed floating on the ocean of my heritage, just around the time my family was making its way over from Europe. Older Rose's remark that, ""It was the ship of dreams. And it was. It really was,"" ring so true. I beseech my readers: regard the volume of immigrant ship traffic in the era, admire the interior of the ship and the costumes of the passengers and contrast them to the most luxurious modern cruise liners, in an era where ships are often not a necessity, and consider how much the Western world lost in less than a century. (This sort of aesthetic history lesson is the same reason I love Chariots of Fire.)Regard, admire, compare and consider... if, that is, you can get past a script that hangs together like a soggy potato chip and pays not the least attention to real historical personages.Our two protagonists are at best na√Øvely laughable and at worst totally unsympathetic, their antagonists little more than cartoon characters. That the former speak like modern teenagers is quite appropriate, because they clearly ARE modern teenagers pitted against the backward old fogies of the era. Jack is a romanticized Bohemian bum with little that could possibly seduce a beautiful young Anglo-American socialite away from her privileged life. Rose wants us to believe¬óand she convinces Jack, somehow¬óthat deep down she's some sort of fiery rebel, yet what I saw was a girl alternating between doing the bidding of her wealthy, domineering cardboard-cutout fianc√© Cal and the bidding of her impoverished, sappy, cardboard-looking loverboy Jack. There's so much ham and cheese at work you'll want to take a fork and start eating.And there is something utterly vile about their story, which, again, is clearly aimed at adolescent females, and that fact makes Titanic's moral tone all the more disturbing. This is a film with an agenda: all the authority figures are stupid murderous bigots, the 17-year-old heroine is glorified for rebelling against her mother and fornicating with a wild rover, and don't forget that wicked cabin church excluding third-class passengers from attending the Sunday service on that fateful last day of Titanic's voyage.In reality, the whole ship was completely segregated. I am told church services were excepted, though I have my doubts, but not because of snobbery on anyone's part. Third-class passengers were largely immigrants without medical certificates and in that era of the great migrations, were required to register at Ellis Island; hence U.S. law required complete segregation on all inbound European ships. And, on these grounds, it scarcely needs saying, such a liaison between Jack and Rose, far from stupid and implausible, was quite impossible.Finally, despite the segregation, Doug Phillips has pointed out, ""there is no credible evidence that first-class passengers were given priority seating rights. To the contrary, there are numerous accounts of first-class passengers giving up their seats and assisting third-class passengers into lifeboats.""There are plenty of other factual gaffes, many of them less severe (such as the bad British accents), but by far the most appalling is the libelous depiction of the ship's crew. There is no evidence that William Murdoch accepted bribes from a cowardly aristocrat, nor that he shot two men, nor that he subsequently committed suicide, and so far as I know, such a portrayal was a completely ad hoc invention on the writers' part. (James Cameron's apology to the Murdoch family was too little, too late.) The surviving passengers testified that the crew performed their duties sacrificially and heroically that evening. That is the biggest sin of this film: the real heroes of the Titanic tragedy (with the exception of Thomas Andrews) are washed over or even villanized in favor of capricious brats, only one of whom gets his comeuppance.Even so, towards the ship's final gasp of life, we do get a good sense of the imminent terror not only in Jack and Rose, but in all 1,500 souls who perished that evening. The worst moment had to be the power outage: it's those last, frightening milestones on the road to destruction that remind you where you are headed irreversibly, and the scene of the actual sinking captures this perfectly. The true story of the RMS Titanic, from its building to its sinking, and even its aftermath as grown Belfast men whose labor on that ship had been the pride and joy of their city wept in the streets at the news of her demise, is beautifully tragic and inspirational. Would that this film had captured more than a few minutes of that.",3/10
GOAT,carlhannan-18311,12 July 2020,"How is this not in the top 250? This movie was breathtaking and inspiring. My new favorite! The love story goes deeper in meaning than any other. In some ways this movie is also a tribute to the power of memory and means so much more than is seen on the surfce. The cast was well picked, I cannot think of any actor or actress who would have played the roles better. James Cameron did an impecible job of being detail oriented when it came to the true events that took place in 1912. Additionally, the movie was so well done that while watching, it feels as though you are transported to the actual event. MASTERPIECE",10/10
"""I don't know about you, but I intend to write a strongly worded letter to the White Star Line about all of this.""",dabrygo,16 April 2023,"Some kids had dinosaurs. Some kids had baseball cards. I had Titanic. (Not the movie for me, though, just the ship.) Then there must have been some time in my life where I watched this a zillion times, right? Nope, this is my second time. Well, based on my previous obsession, do I have any insights or trivia to add to how the movie approached its subject technically? No, not really, no. My Titanic mania happened a long time ago. Furthermore, most of the information I had would have come from video games -- some educational, but also Gex64 -- and children's books. (For instance, I never associated the Titanic with Ireland, but the movie says that's where the ship was built and started from when it sailed to America.) One ""grown-up book"" exception to this was that, before watching the first time, I borrowed a book based on the movie from the library -- and accidentally tore a page after feeling how glossy they were. You could look through some of my college textbooks before my senior year and not find a new dogear (let alone any other newly placed stray mark) in them, and I firmly believe that this incident played a role in why that is...My interest in the Titanic was largely based on how ""it had everything"" or ""you wouldn't have to leave if you didn't want to,"" similar to how I felt when I heard some skyscrapers had their own restaurants, gyms, gardens, etc. The movie makes it sound like the maiden voyage wasn't supposed to be long, but at the same time it does capture the ship's opulence with its many expansive and various rooms -- even the ship's mechanical areas and boiler room seem luxurious and imposing. There are some rough areas, but in other areas the CGI stands up pretty well to today's animation, I thought.A major draw for me at the time would have been the ship's sinking scenes. (In retrospect, I think the movie I wanted to see then was ""The Poseidon Adventure""; the ship sinking plays a prominent role in this movie, but it's not until the third act/hour.) I would have liked that because of being able to see in live-action what I mostly gathered from pictures and descriptions in books. And the movie does a good job of simulating for viewers what it would have been like to be on the sinking Titanic. Not just technically, but also emotionally or viscerally. There's a cold terror to watching the iceberg and freezing water -- sometimes slowly seeping in, sometimes rushing in in furious torrents -- take down this iron giant, with a few souls trapped in the ship's abandoned underbelly while confused masses fight for lifeboat positions on its deck. There's a point when the ship becomes less of an ally against the brutal elements and more of an enemy, with the ship's violent crashing into the ocean and forming a vortex as it sinks.I was a fan of Alvin, a submersible that explored the ship's wreckage. So the modern-day part of the story is what I remember most, where a salvage crew is using similar technologies to search for an elusive diamond, The Heart of the Ocean, rumored to have gone down with the ship. The exploratory technology struck me as pretty advanced, if only for the time, with the submersible's pilot wearing what looked like virtual reality goggles and being able to control the robot's mechanical arms with his own. It also seemed like there should be some kind of technology -- maybe not x-ray or infrared, but something like it -- for the salvage crew to examine the safe and its contents before bringing them to the surface. I don't know if the movie is completely accurate in its depiction of (deep?) sea exploration. One of my favorite stories of all time is the back-and-forth between director James Cameron and Dr Neil DeGrasse Tyson about getting the actual night sky into this movie, so it wouldn't surprise me if some parts of the movie were more accurate than others.I didn't remember much of the rest of the story, and was worried that that was because I didn't like it. (Now I think it's more because the first/last time I watched this, I was on medication.) The majority of the story takes place when the Titanic set sail in 1912 and follows two lovers who met on the voyage and who, as fate would have it, stay on the ship to the bitter end. Kate Winslet stars as Rose, a young lady who is betrothed to a well-to-do foreman (Billy Zane) and who is not excited about the voyage until she meets the vivacious drifter artist Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is onboard because of a lucky poker hand. There are nods to several historical figures, especially Molly Brown, whom I would have known from the musical ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown,"" whose depiction of the Titanic whet my appetite for this movie.I've always liked the theme song, ""My Heart Will Go On."" It was on the radio a lot, during a kind of golden age of great movie music, especially Disney fare like Pocahontas and Mulan. Think Mom got me the piano sheet music and I have a memory of her mom playing it on her stereo. It isn't until the credits that you hear Celine sing it though.The dialog seems a little odd sometimes, but the delivery is always good because the acting is so good. Winslet's fear during the ship sinking scenes especially sounds genuine. There was a scene when she was rescuing Jack where she looked like she was positively freezing. (I hope that was make-up!)It's a long-ish movie but all of it is very interesting. Think it's got me a little excited about Titanic the ship again too.",8/10
overinflated lack of realism and clich√©s,dixxjamm,21 March 2008,"Don't wanna bother too much with this one, so I'll give 2 points for the technical part.Ship sinking - good, and so on. As for the rest: childish screenplay,idiotic intrigue,a good-hearted Robin Hood Picasso--DeCaprio in a relationship with Ms.Rich Bitch (I thought this looked like a lesbian relationship, with Winslet being the dominant partner).As for the depiction of the class issue,it reminded me of some Communist propaganda stories.The whole feel of the movie is second-rate sentimentalism.The other characters are incredibly one-sided (Billy Zane looks like a Bond villain and the rich people are the worst bastards I have ever seen).1 billion dollars wasted in a giant corny video-clip.This movie made me sick.As for Celine Dion and her over-hyped song...no comment,except I had no idea that cheesy and corny are the qualities needed for an Oscar-winning song.Now I know. Actors were really alright,but the movie is so melodramatically over the top that it's just insulting....",3/10
"The greatest movie, ever.",ontariowarrior,20 November 2021,"From start to end, Titanic is a beautiful movie depicting a horrible tragedy. Titanic has the most romantic scene in cinema history that truly will never be toped, and also some of the most painful, gut wrenching scenes of humans trying to survive, and accepting the inevitable fate.

Skip It,Angry_Arguer,3 May 2003,"Romance movies are not my genre.  There I said it, now all you teenage girls (or ex-teenage girls I should probably say) can come with torches to my house and protest.  That said, I think this movie is not only a dud on the technical level, but also on the content plateu.James Cameron loves creating megadose action flicks (Terminator 2, True Lies, etc.) that usually require little background or very uninvolving plots.  The guy has little to no screenwriting ability (if you read his scripts, particularly for ALIENS, you will see that there is nothing to applaud.  Fortunately, as a director, Cameron can transcend the difficulties of putting images on paper and creating some impressive images (even if the scenes themselves are rather dull).By all means, ABYSS and Terminator 2 deserved Oscars for Cinematography, but this movie is merely overrated end-of-the-year garbage (see also CHICAGO) that lacks emotion and style in his camerawork.  Much of his work here in Titanic seems more like he's stealing ideas from Brian DePalma rather than being inventive.Cameron learned from Corman, plain and simple, and that similar attitude is displayed here.  Grabbing a cast from a fashion catalogue, Cameron proves (once again) that he hasn't lost his touch in how to be EXPLOITIVE of human emotion.  That might explain his love life problems.On the rest of the technical notes, this movie did NOT deserve most of the awards it was nominated for.  The Sound is on par with T2 (read: awful) and the effects were unenlightening.  Someone want to explain how Face/Off didn't get that award?  The visual and SFX were fair.  Fair to poor that is, Cameron has lost his ability to know when to use CGI and when not to. Film editing= totally awful, this was waaayy to long even for me.  Hence I fell asleep three times during the sinking.Music= James Horner's score is nothing new. It rather reminded me of ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Ben-Hur"".  If I had a time machine, I would've given him the Oscar for ALIENS instead.  And as for the Director, what a joke. Now Cameron has become a recluse crackhead rather than therecluse genius he was.So do the math, I have succeeded in knocking off 7 Oscars from this overrated POS.  Now it's on par with Forrest Gump where it belongs. Overall: 1.5 out of 5. Don't waste your time.",No Rating
The most overrated film ever,Spacetree,12 April 2005,"I don't get it. What was spectacular about Titanic? Sure, the special effects were nice for the time, but groundbreaking? Not in my book. The characters were... well likable. Not lovable, nor classic, but likable. The plot? Cookie-cutter. Poor boy meets rich girl, poor boy falls instantly in love with rich girl, rich girl does the same, poor boy dies (Seriously, were you not expecting someone to die. You knew the boat was going to sink). Throw in a historical tragedy, and Wam! Insta-plot. And it gets 11 Oscars. What happened? I mean, Titanic certainly wasn't a make-up Oscar for Cameron for T2.Titanic is one of those films where they intentionally stuff as many things to tug on the heartstrings as possible without actually being engaging or interesting. Pearl Harbor did the EXACT same formula, yet critics panned it.It's OK, yet not sensational in anyway.",3/10
A classic...,paul_haakonsen,4 July 2023,"I have always been interested in the events of the sinking of the worlds greatest luxury liner, since I was a pre-teen. And when James Cameron released the 1997 movie ""Titanic"", of course it was a big deal. However, I just wasn't a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio back in the day, but of course had to watch the movie for historical reasons.Writer and director James Cameron really stood proudly at the helm of this project and ensured that the world was taken on a doomed oceanic adventure unlike any other. With great attention to detail and realism, ""Titanic"" would sweep away the world. And yeah, I was swept away as well.While Jack and Rose might be fictional characters placed aboard the Titanic, you can't help but marvel at James Cameron's 1997 movie. It looked spectacular back in 1997, and I just watched it again here in 2023, and it still looks spectacular. I am really impressed with how authentic everything looks and feel in the movie, just as if setting foot aboard the majestic ship myself.The cast ensemble in ""Titanic"" is great. And while I wasn't a fan of DiCaprio back in 1997, I must say that with my own growth and maturing, I have come to appreciate his acting talent. And that has made it all the more enjoyable with each return to watch ""Titanic"" that I have done since 1997, and there has been a handful of returns to this movie for me. The movie also have such performers as Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bill Paxton, David Warner, Victor Garber and Jonathan Hyde on the cast list, and they really add their great talents to the movie and brings their characters to life on the screen quite well.Visually, then I have to say that James Cameron marveled at bringing the Titanic to life. I was overwhelmed and beyond amazed back in 1997 and I have to admit that I still am in 2023. The movie really is an impressive display of visual eye-candy and with great attention to detail. Everything from the d√©cor of the ship to the thrilling sinking scene really looks spectacular.I would say that James Cameron's 1997 movie ""Titanic"" is a classic and it is a movie that everyone is familiar with in one way or another.My rating of ""Titanic"" lands on a well-deserved eight out of ten stars.",8/10

Why in the world would it win Best Picture Oscar. That should have went to L.A. Confidential or As Good As It Gets.  I do enjoy Kathy Bates in everything I see and Kate Winslet was all right.  But James Cameron's cheap theatrics with a false love story aboard the doomed ship was just a way to sell tickets, and adding ""DiCraprio"" was just icing on the cake for him.  If you like good movies, rent ""Boogie Nights"" and if you like a Titanic movie, rent ""A Night to Remember"", please.",No Rating
Good,tvpoket-14621,12 September 2023,"Directed by James Cameron, Titanic is without a doubt one of the most iconic films of the late '90s. This epic romantic tragedy brings to life the true story of the RMS Titanic, combined with a fictional love story between Jack Dawson Leonardo DiCaprio and Rose DeWitt Bukater Kate Winslet. The cinematography is beautiful, with breathtaking shots of the ship and the icy Atlantic Ocean. The detailed set designs and costumes transport the viewer to the early 20th century, to a world of luxury and innocence that was destined to end in tragedy. DiCaprio and Winslet have undeniable chemistry, and their performances have left a lasting impression in the hearts of many viewers. The supporting cast, including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates and Bill Paxton, provide solid supporting roles that add depth to the story. Still, the film has its shortcomings. The script can feel melodramatic at times, and some criticisms focus on the historical inaccuracies and the way certain characters are portrayed. The unforgettable soundtrack, composed by James Horner and featuring the hit My Heart Will Go Unsung by Celine Dion, adds to the emotional impact of the film. Overall, Titanic is a visual and emotional masterpiece that takes viewers on a harrowing journey of love, loss and survival. While it may not be perfect, it remains a timeless piece of cinema that will continue to move generations.",9/10

There's so much depth to every aspect of this movie. You get lost in the magnificence of the ship in this movie, but also in the characters within the storyline. This is really a unique setting and set of circumstances to depict a love story. The backstory of each character is well developed as well as their current state circumstances and perspectives. The sound track is perfection and fit the film perfectly. Once the ship hits the iceberg the movie gets intense quickly and depicts those circumstances in depth as well.

Zarina,dostan-85075,15 October 2019,"I saw this film long ago but remember that it took my breath away and we are still talking about this movie.
The fictional story of two main actors was absolutely beautiful. Kate Winslet was gorgeous as Rose and i couldn't imagine anyone else playing this role. And Leonardo DiCaprio was really good as Jack. The acting is first-rate. Leonardo Di Caprio's and Kate Winslet's performance is so brilliant that I cried during the whole movie.
This movie has it all; drama, action, romance and it makes the viewer fall in love with each and every scene. Also it is very close to the real tragedy. It shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending.It's emotionally so powerful that it breaks the viewer into tears.
If you want to cry and melt down to a glamurous love story, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie. Titanic is well worth seeing.AizereTitanic is very tough movie to watch and this film is directed by James Cameron.The film is not new, but does not go out of fashion, does not leave indifferent even a person who is used to constantly hide emotions. Shown fear and love. It is instructive and even interesting to look at the behavior of people from the side, as if with the actors of the film you are experiencing what is happening in the film. Sometimes it seems that this is reality, but pincing yourself by the arm you understand that this is only a film. There is no pretense in the game of actors, it pleases me.I really liked the film, I can't even say exactly what, just EVERYTHING with which it was made. Watching it, I feel myself there on the Titanic, after the film I immediately begin to have a value in life, I would never want to die like these people who were on board. I would even like to see the Titanic myself with my own eyes at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.The film has touched my soul so much that I don't think there is a film that will surpass the Titanic in its drama. This is my favorite movie from melodramas, and one of my favorite films in general. I really advice to watch this masterpiece.",10/10

The wonderful score by James Horner initiated some of those teardrops.This is about the fateful night in mid-April of 1912 when the luxury liner Titanic sank. Also, there is a romance story between a guy from the lower class and a girl from the upper class.The acting is pretty great. Yes there were some cheesy lines but so what. The brilliant performances of Kate and Leo make up for it.I can't see why people blast this movie with their criticisms.

It was bad enough that Titanic won anything at all but for it to be named Best Picture over LA Confidential (or any other good film that came out in 1997) is a crime against anyone who values well-acted, intelligent and well-crafted films. Titanic is basically an overblown soap opera featuring a man-boy hero (Leo DiCaprio), a cartoonish bad-guy (Zane), and an inaccurate portrayal of life in 1912 and of events that took place that terrible night.    Women in those days did not flip the bird.  No Titanic officers or crewmen killed anyone or committed suicide with a gun. What is worst is that Titanic is simply a banal film.

My favorite film,imdb-58910,25 January 2019,"I absolutely like this movie! It is the best romantic drama, fantastic direct, gripping music, very good actors, beautiful story... great combination that predestines good results. The film stars Kate Winslet (Rose DeWitt Bukater) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson).
The story is about young lover were so different world. Rose is very rich girl. She is engagement with rich man- Caledon Hockley. Rose is unhappy, she must leave to New York to she could get married in NYC. They travel in upper-class with her mother Ruth. Jack and his friend Fabrizio win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. Rose want kill herself. Jack- poore boy and painter save her before jump from ship. Lovers met and love story started...
This story always inspiring me and I often thinking about this film, this story. About lifes a thousand people, about ,,Ship of dream""
My opinion is that life is too short and we must enjoy every moment with people that we loved. Titanic is about this.
You will certainly give me the truth when I write that Titanic is very moving.

Love it,mrreed-17210,5 December 2020,"It certainly has its flaws. Mainly in dialogue (occasionally) but this film is wildly entertaining and thus being a 3 hour movie it doesn't really stagger. You feel the true journey of the ship and not just it's final moments above water. Leo and Kate are great in this. King Kathy bates is also perfect. The set, costumes, make up, music, visuals/cinematography, directing all wonderful. It's a great classic film that presents itself as powerful as the ship appeared to be. Even though the ending isn't what a Leo fan girl wants it does allow you to feel more of what the survivors feel wondering if their loved ones survived or if they knew they hadn't. James Cameron is always ambitious with his films but this one is distinguishing. Not the best love story ever but defiantly an iconic one.

And I don't care if you say its too depressing to watch. I watched it a second time and I cried just as much as I did as the first time. And you know what, it was great. If you have a girlfriend/wife, and if neither or one of you hasn't seen it, go see it together. She will cry (maybe) but you will get laid. How do I know this; experience. James Cameron, your movies are the best. Do not stop making movies. I really want to see what you will surprise everyone with next.",10/10
Titanic,CinemaSerf,27 August 2023,"Set around the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS ""Titanic"", this is essentially a film in two parts. The first, weaker, element features a young ""Dawson"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wins a third class ticket to New York on the soon to depart liner. Meantime, the wealthy but unhappy ""Rose"" (Kate Winslet) is up in the posh cabins with her cold and unfeeling fianc√©e ""Hockley"" (Billy Zane) and her equally unpleasant, venally ambitious mother ""Ruth"" (Frances Fisher). Desperately unhappy, ""Rose"" considers jumping off the prow of the boat, but luckily the charming young ""Dawson"" is on hand to talk her down, and so begins their friendship that causes much chagrin amongst her socially elite companions. That friendship culminates in him making a rather provocative drawing of her, the final straw for her boyfriend and his enforcer ""Lovejoy"" (David Warner). It all looks ominous for both until - part two begins. The ship, speeding along nicely under the command of Bernard Hill's Captain Smith clips the underwater part of an iceberg and now history takes over. James Cameron offers us a purely speculative account of what might have happened as the initially incredulous crew start to realise that maybe it is not just Molly Brown (an excellent Kathy Bates) that's unsinkable! What now ensues are a series of well staged scenarios depicting panic, fear, a fair degree of selfishness and some proper stiff upper lips as the ship has be evacuated and the segregation of the passengers and competencies of the crew start to become life threatening. The visual effects have dated, the smoke from the ship's funnels blows in an strangely symmetrical fashion and the later scenes struggle to convince - but this is really a rather tragic love story with a strong chemistry between the engaging two characters at the top of the bill, and an effective performance from the older ""Rose"" (Gloria Stewart) who takes on the role of narrator 80 years after the disaster. I still find it uncomfortable to watch the actuality of the wreck, which features occasionally throughout the film - I feel like I am quite literally walking through someone's grave; but it does lend a potent hook upon which this lengthy, but well thought out and constructed drama is presented. Criticisms have been made of it's factual inaccuracies, and it may well play a bit fast and loose with some of the real characterisations - but it's a drama, and to be enjoyed has to be appreciated in that sphere. Big screen is a must, it really does lose a great deal on a television.",7/10
disgustingly revolting,devalier,1 June 1999,"I almost always refrain from posting negative reviews.  What I find ridiculous may be sublime to others.  However, this is one movie that I find so disgustingly revolting that I cannot resist adding my unwelcomed two-cents.If you're one of the three people on earth who hasn't seen the film, PLEASE take my advice and find something more constructive to do with your time.Director/writer James Cameron has reduced a TRULY horrific event into a ludicrously trite love story that makes Days of Our Lives seem like a Shakespearean tragedy by comparison.  Instead of focusing the story on actual people and events,  Cameron took the easy way out and created a cast of dull, sterotypical characters who spout inane dialogue seemingly lifted from a tv-movie-of-the-week.  Rampant historical inaccuracies, cliched directing, uninspired acting, and ridiculously cheap sentimentality all add up to one over-hyped, overrated spectacle.The only thing more nauseating than the film itself was James Cameron's ""moment of silence"" at the Oscars for the real victims of the disaster. The ""movie"" Titanic has about as much to do with the actual disaster as the Police Academy movies do with law enforcement.  This film isn't a testament to human tragedy...it's a disgusting marketing ploy aimed at bilking moviegoers out of money,  while making a mockery out of those people who experienced an event that no one should ever face.",1/10
Average,Arkaan,29 November 1999,"I admit I enjoyed this film.  The grandeur of it all was impressive.  The fact that James Cameron let this film get to a 200 million dollar budget is also very impressive.  However, once the grandeur is taken away there really isn't much left.  The plot is a simple romance.  And since the story is so predictable, it puts some heavy pressure on a three hour film.  The direction is superb.  My distaste for this film doesn't extend to James Cameron's technical direction.  His technical direction is on par with Spielberg's.  However, his human/emotional part of that mix doesn't rate very well.  The acting also is not consistent.  I didn't find DiCaprio's performance bad, but his character seemed to be very easy to play and wasn't that complicated.  Winslet, who's performance in Heavenly Creatures stunned me, is mainly okay here.  The best performances belonged to Gloria Stuart and Kathy Bates.  The score also rates with the best, and the soundtrack is one I highly recommend.  In the end, I think this film is more comparable to ""Cleopatra"" than to ""Gone With Wind"".  The budget and the problems making the film end up being more interesting and more entertaining than the film itself.  Did this film deserve best picture? No.  But it's nomination was also like ""Cleopatra's"" nomination.  The big budget and the absolute vastness of the film was enough.",No Rating
Big boat sinks,smarty-13,6 July 1999,"TITANIC ( rating * * out of 5 )I fear I'm about to make myself highly unpopular with what follows, but I can only call 'em as I see 'em. Besides, being highly unpopular is such familiar territory for me and it just wouldn't be the same without the constant slings and pointed arrows.From writer/director James (I'm king of the world) Cameron, comes this 200 million dollar purported epic that in my view only ever reaches the status of cubic zirconia.But never fear, Hollywood will incestuously look after its own because any movie that costs the amount that could pull a third world South American country out of insolvency and destitution, is guaranteed to win eleven Academy Awards - Oscars for categories like, The Most Times Actors Say, ""No! This Way."" - The Most Soggy Extras and The Best Motion Picture Where The Male Lead Is Snubbed For A Nomination.This unfortunate male lead is none other than Leonardo Di Caprio who possesses all the rugged good-looks of a fourteen year old pimple-cream model. But it's not all bad news for Leo because he has perfected the art of being a pipsqueak while painting chubby actresses in the nude - poor old Kate Winslet's dress was so tight around the torso that the hunky Leo had to use solvent to get it off.Rose DeWitt (Kate Winslet), is engaged to the jerk millionaire, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). Cal gives her a priceless necklace that has some significance later on as a wrinkly Rose tells the story which is seen in flashback.Anyway, Rose meets Jack (Leonardo Di Caprio), as she attempts suicide and the couple are instantly attracted (in Rose's case, as much as someone who is attempting suicide can be). The pair eventually fall in love, the ship hits an iceberg, the ship sinks, the ship becomes famous and we are subjected to this hideously expensive, self-important and time-consuming movie (I had to pause halfway through to bake some muffins as not to suffer the effects of malnutrition).However, I did give this movie two stars and that was for the special effects. To be fair, they were pretty good. As a mass of brave stunt-personnel tumbled into the icy water, I did get the sense of what the chaos and hysteria must have been like on that fateful night in 1912 - reminiscent of lunch-time crowds around the all-you-can-eat desert bar at Sizzler.In a nutshell, this film is a love story between Jack and Rose that never rises above soap-opera melodramatics. After an hour and a half of this kissy kissy nonsense, I found myself participating in open prayer thanking the Almighty for his very timely iceberg.What possibly could warrant so much money and effort? Certainly not a piece of Hollywood trivia that tells us nothing about the Titanic that we didn't already know.If I've missed the point, then to all of you 'Titanic' devotees I sincerely apologize. But, if I'm right, then you have all been the victims of Hollywood and its intricate network of propaganda.",No Rating
10/10,aveldaheaney,2 January 2023,"It's been several decades since I had the chance to watch James Cameron's masterful epic, and watching it again after all this time, I can honestly say that my feelings haven't changed: this is an exhilarating film from top to bottom, from the magnificent visuals and a love story that deserves its place among Hollywood's best.For starters, the entire cast is a knockout, with appearances by actors such as Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates, Maggie Smith, and Billy Zane, to name a few, but it's Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio's magnetic performances where Titanic truly shines.Despite being victim to countless parodies over the years, the spark between Rose and Jack remains every bit as powerful. There's also a surprising amount of humor - I especially loved the moments we see Rose abandon her ""polite girl"" status in order to help Jack, or when people begin breaking down gates or doors in order to navigate their way out of the ship.Director James Cameron truly hit a grand slam visually, and seeing that ship captured in such a beautiful and expansive light was every bit as exciting as I remember seeing in the theater. Now that I've aged a bit since then, watching the sinking of the ship made me realize why this is such a long movie - it takes time for the entire event to unfold, making the infamous tragedy all the more nerve-wracking. The entire final act is one of the most beautifully staged and thrilling sequences the movies have given us, with tension becoming higher and higher as the water slowly makes its way through the ship, and the panic and chaos among the passengers rising to terrifying heights.All in all, TITANIC certainly earned its place among cinema's finest moments. It's an exciting and emotional ride that hasn't lost its glow, and I'm beyond happy to have been able to watch this again, despite my own reservations.",10/10
Underrated comedy that might be better than Airplane!,bodyshots80,15 February 2003,When I watched Jack die I literally began to cry because I knew that I would never see something as funny as that.  It was sentimental and it warmed many peoples' hearts.  You actually think that this movie is so funny and fake that you can't bear it and then you get to see his lifeless body frozen in the water.  The only thing that could have made this movie better is if Old Rose had been thrown into the water or killed and eaten.  If you like this I suggest you rent The Texas Chainsaw Massacre... the movie is not quite as graphic or shocking but you will also like it.,1/10

After the first 45 minutes, I got up and did some cleaning, came back about an hour later, and didn't notice I missed a thing.

Utter Failure of a Film,LeonLouisRicci,2 June 2012,"""there are only lifeboats for half the people... yea the better half"".The segregation, oppression, and unenlightened separation of the privileged few from the unkempt, unwashed masses is the ""dramatic"" thread that seems to be the ""soul"" of this bloated, overwritten, orally deficient melodrama. It is completely counterpointed by the very last scene. An antithesis of the socially conscious concern of the film makers.It is morally reprehensible, irresponsible, incomprehensible, and downright selfish. One wonders how many underprivileged children with empty bellies and deplorable living conditions could have been saved by that mega-million dollar necklace.

Titanic (1997) - I'm the King of the World!!!!!!!!!!!,nickmesafilms,21 May 2011,"Remember the world's most heartbreaking moment, the sinking of the Titanic? Well, memories come back to us when the incredible James Cameron and his big imagination create a powerful love story disaster. The film is a fictional love story, taking place in a historical event. Set to the sinking of the Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio plays a poor man named Jack, who falls in love with a rich woman named Rose, portrayed by Kate Winslet. Although separated by the number of money in their pockets, that does not stop the love between each other. Then, when Titanic begins to sink, sacrifices are being made, and Jack would do anything in his power to make Rose safe. James Cameron let out his heart into this movie, and really wanted to express his feelings on the sinking. Though the film is sad, and maybe too graphic, the film was a beautiful masterpiece portrayed by an amazing cast, a great direction, an amazing re-creation of history, brilliant costumes, breathtaking art direction, scene-stealing sound effects, visionary film editing, and exhilarating visual effects. I watch the movie over and over again and never got tired of enjoying it, cause it will never leave your heart. I'll never forget watching this movie, and I'll respect that it won the Best Picture on my birth year, and glad it made a billion dollars in the box office. This movie will always be epic and romantic in every way. This is a visual marvel, but it also has great characters and a terrific story to go along with it. ""Titanic"", in my review, ""a beautiful masterpiece of the heart, something to enjoy watching over and over.""Oh, and speaking of the 3D re-release, it's worth your money! Even if this movie was made in 1997, James Cameron is one of those filmmakers that knows how to make perfect use of the 3-D, and he makes it look like the movie was made in 3-D. Even if you wish that James Cameron should have cut the film 20 minutes shorter, you still believe that every single detail that James Cameron added, had to be there in the movie. The 3-D literally draws you into the adventure, frankly because this is the type of 3-D that is used perfectly, just like in ""Avatar"". So, go out and watch it again in the special 3-D treatment!",10/10
A Triumph in Special Effects but Hokey Romance Sinks Overall Rating,Turfseer,1 December 2023,"Titanic, in its heyday, dazzled audiences with groundbreaking visual effects, but let's not pretend James Cameron's epic was a seamless sail through cinematic excellence. No, dear reader, we must grapple with the fact that the first half of this oceanic saga is essentially a pedestrian soap opera, and not the kind that wins awards for its suds.We kick off with the geriatric Rose, played by the venerable Gloria Stuart, emerging from obscurity like a Titanic-themed AARP commercial. The catalyst? The discovery of a tastefully rendered nude drawing of her, stowed away in the ship's depths. Why Rose has kept silent for a century about her Titanic escapades is as mysterious as why we still get robocalls in the age of intergalactic travel. Maybe she just liked her privacy, or perhaps she was busy binge-watching underwater documentaries. Who knows?The film sets sail with a snooze-inducing sequence featuring a submersible exploring the Titanic's watery grave. If that doesn't make you nod off, the expedition leaders, a crew of unlikable sailors with potty mouths rivaling a sailor's vocabulary, surely will. You'll wish for an iceberg to spice things up.Flashback to 1912, where we're treated to a less than epic love story between the uppity Rose (Kate Winslet) and the penniless artist Jack Dawson (Leo DiCaprio). Forget the multi-character drama of ""A Night to Remember""; Cameron opts for a one-dimensional romance that feels like a rushed game of relationship roulette won by a last-minute card-playing artist. Talk about a winning hand, or not.The upper-class passengers are mostly cardboard cutouts in eveningwear, and the prize for the vilest goes to Rose's fianc√©, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), a man so detestable even his clean-shaven face looks villainous. Rose's mother, determined to marry her off for financial redemption, adds a dash of familial drama, but it's more like iceberg lettuce in a salad of clich√©s.The break into Act II features the attempt at cinematic self-destruction by our beloved Rose, who, driven by her loathing for the tyrannical Cal and the snobbish elites she grew up with, contemplates a daring leap overboard. Enter Jack, the clich√©d ""salt of the earth,"" who swoops in to save her, cementing his role as the unsinkable hero.It's a missed opportunity to add nuance to the characters. Cal could use a redeeming quality or two, and Jack could've benefitted from a flaw or at least a bad haircut. Alas, Cameron sticks to his script like a Titanic passenger to a lifeboat.Some supporting actors shine, with Kathy Bates as the lively sassy Molly Brown and Victor Garber as the kind-hearted architect Thomas Andrews, injecting life into the film like a breath of fresh ocean air.The first half hits rock bottom with a laughable love scene in a car inside the ship's cargo hold. Subtlety apparently sank with the ship.But fear not, dear reader, for as the iceberg looms, so does the film's salvation. The interior scenes, based on the original ship designs, are a visual feast. Cameron captures the growing panic with finesse, using a large-scale model of the ship. If only Jack and Rose's relationship had half the depth.The film's highlight is the depiction of the Titanic breaking in two, a departure from sanitizing history as seen in earlier versions. Cameron doesn't shy away from the grim truth of class disparity during the sinking, but things take a nosedive with absurd scenes of shootings and attempted murder that feel more like a misguided action flick than a historical drama.Suspension of disbelief is mandatory as the freezing water turns into a bizarre survival pool party. Despite the questionable realism, the image of bobbing corpses sticks like a barnacle, and Jack's frozen demise etches itself into memory.James Horner's score adds emotional weight, and ""My Heart Will Go On"" ensures that even if the ship sinks, Celine Dion's voice will rise. However, Winslet's theatrics verge on melodramatic, while DiCaprio's Jack is a saintly figure in a script that forgot to give him a dark side.For a more compelling and realistic Titanic experience, dive into ""A Night to Remember,"" technical shortcomings be damned. It's a reminder that sometimes, less CGI and more substance make for a smoother cinematic voyage.",5/10

"Alright film, but over-rated",davidgoesboating,19 March 2005,"This may contain spoilers...... OK just a little bit of background to this review. Firstly, yes I was one of that 0.01% who did not see this movie at the cinemas when it came out. Secondly, when I did see it for the first time on TV last year, I missed the first 45 minutes. However, I saw enough of this movie to see how ridiculously over-rated it was. Firstly, the positives, and there weren't a whole lot. Number one: yes, the special effects were as good as they were supposed to be. The design of the Titanic was amazing. Also the bit at the end where the ship sinks was incredible. Number two: Kate Winslet has a nice body, and you do get to see a lot more of it than I thought you would...... although one could be a bit cynical about that scene, that they only put it in to get more people to watch it. That's about it for the positives. Now for the negatives: Leonardo Di Caprio can't really act. OK, I thought he did well in Romeo and Juliet (which is one of my favorite movies) but his acting and dialog are just really wooden in Titanic. The characters as a whole are just one-dimensional. One of the most laughable points was though how many life-or-death situations there are for Leo and Kate in the last hour (yes, the movie takes forever to finish). First Leonardo gets locked down below deck as the water level slowly rises (ooh will he survive????) and of course gets rescued by Kate Winslet after about 15 minutes. Then Kate's evil fianc√©e (yes not much room for development in that character) starts shooting at them so they have to run back 5 levels deep before deciding to go back on top. Here they face a literal ""class barrier"" (big metaphor there of course) a big iron gate, which, with help from the other battling workers, Leonardo bravely breaks down. Forgive my sarcasm, but it was hard not to roll my eyes throughout this whole sequence. Then after narrowly surviving half a dozen near-death experiences, Leonardo dies in the lamest way possible. Instead of attempting to find another piece of debris to float on in the water, he rather unnecessarily lets winslet have the whole piece of wood to float on, and lets himself freeze to death. But perhaps the worst part of all was the sequences where we go back to the old 101-year old version of Kate Winslet telling the story, with a bunch of young scientists passing social commentary on it. I've always hated this idea, because it gives away the ending of the film. The viewer knows that she will survive, and Leonardo won't. Which sort of takes away from any of the suspense. Anyhow, I would recommend this movie to anyone (not that you haven't seen it already) but go in with a low expectation and you might find it a decent film. Certainly don't watch it, though, expecting to see a film that deserved 11 Oscars, cos you will be disappointed.",3/10
Great Movie,cinemapersonified,13 June 2023,"Rating: 9.1
Overall, a great movie that has many iconic elements to depict a grand and tragic event as we see James Cameron step outside of his comfort zone to create one of the best love stories ever told on film, though it is really held back from its long runtime that really could have been cut to make the climax more tight.Very Good to Great from Direction (He is able to get a lot from the macro scale of the movie as he builds this grand voyage that comes to its demise, and he does a good job in the more interpersonal scenes as he makes the audience care for the characters; there are issues with how he cut the film and uses pacing as the final half of the movie feels very dragged out despite it being a chaotic event (to where the ending becomes a bit too boring despite it being captivating)), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good from Leonardo DiCaprio (Shows some of his inexperience but plays the lead role very well as he commands the scenes he is in), Good to Very Good from Kate Winslet (Does not show too much depth throughout the movie but really does show the loving emotions well to make you care about the relationship she has with Jack), Pretty Good to Good from Billy Zane (Takes a lot from the rich-villain trope as he uses that to fuel his performance (with nothing being too spectacular)), Good from Kathy Bates (Plays a very Kathy Bates character as she has the southern charm who is considerate when looking at the different socioeconomic situations), Pretty Good to Good from Gloria Stuart, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Good to Very Good Story (Filled with many iconic moments and stays very true to what happened, the main issue is how not dense it is for its long runtime (meaning some scenes feel like they are dragged out longer than they need to be)), Very Good Screenplay (The dialogue is of the time and very iconic, the movie is filled with a lot of foreshadowing (though a bit overt), and the symbolism between the separation of classes was a nice touch to see given how much of an issue it was on the actual ship), Great Score (Very Iconic with one of the most iconic/best songs for film every created), Great Cinematography (Helps paint how grand of an experience and event the Titanic was), Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (Helped with painting the scene), Very Good Production Design, Very Good Costumes (Helped with separating the different classes in the movie), Plot Structure was a major drawback for the movie as the climax was way longer than it needed to be (with it being dragged for the final hour and a half of the movie (which I do get cause they said the boat will sink within an hour)), Pacing was on the slower side despite them trying to make a fast/tense mood in the climax (The runtime of the climax could have been cut in half (30-45 minutes) because it felt like there were many unnecessary scenes or scenes that were longer than they needed to be), Climax was a big focal point for the movie and while there were many great/iconic moments it was longer than it needed to be, There were two different tones as the historical/romantic genre tone was done very well in the first half in helping build the scene but the more anxious/desperation scenes was not as well executed, The switching between the present and the past was surprisingly captivating as it helped portray some of the trauma Rose still lives with; the movie tries to be two movies in one when I would have really preferred it give more time before the crash as it would have helped build the relationship between Jack and Rose a lot better.",9/10
One of my all-time Favorites,lucianomarzo92,11 September 2010,"Titanic is one of my favorite movies, and it is a timeless classic that did not receive the acclaim and respect it deserved. I know that it got Oscar nominations, and it received the hype, but its not even in the top 250 which is very disappointing, because Titanic is as least as good if not better than many of the movies in the top 250. It is unfortunate that it was unpopular among so many people. During its day it was the highest grossing film of all time. Unfortunately the success and hype of the movie have spawned vicious criticism. A lot of viewers love Titanic, but many more bash the film and dissect it for problems such as its ""lack of originality"", ""weak script"", and ""poor acting"", all of which are overly critical and not true. Maybe the script could have been a little better, but it was good enough for me. It may have been simple, but it was still well-written in my opinion. I don't know why everyone say's the acting is bad, I thought all of the cast did very well in this movie. As for the originality, its not the first love story to be told, but in my opinion it is the most believable, epic, and heart-wrenching love story to ever be depicted in a movie. The love the two characters have for each other is totally convincing.Titanic does use a historical setting to set the foundation for the movie, but so do a lot of other great movies. A lot of people say they don't like Titanic because it was too long, but I don't think the movie's length is a problem because it's so good that it's worth the 3 hour commitment. Sure, it could have been a little shorter, but I don't know that it would have been made that much of an improvement. Titanic is indeed a very lengthy film, but the movie is breath-taking because of its strong plot, gorgeous cinematography, phenomenal special effects, and superb acting. A lot of people don't like Leonardo Di Caprio in this movie. In fact, many of the people who didn't like this movie blame Di Caprio. Leonardo Di Caprio is not really respected as an actor but often dismissed as a ""pretty boy"". Leonardo Di Caprio is not the greatest actor ever, but he did a good job in this movie, and I find the attacks on his acting to be unfair. In my opinion he did his best work in this movie.Kate Winslet is perfect in Titanic. She is a very gifted actress who is part of what makes this movie so good. But she didn't do it alone: The chemistry between her character and Leonardo Di Caprio's character is so natural, that it does not seem like they acting at all. Kate Winslet plays a young woman from a rich family named Rose, and Leonardo Di Caprio plays a poor artist named Jack. The two meet on the voyage of the Titanic and fall in love. But Rose is strongly encouraged to marry a rich man named Cal Hockley. Rose's family and Cal disapprove of Jack. Throughout the movie Rose and Jack's relationship develops, much to Cal's dismay. Cal becomes the enemy of both Rose and Jack. He hires a man to capture Jack.A real ocean liner was built for the production of this movie. It is not quite as big as the real Titanic but it is close to it. The replica of the ship looks very authentic, it looks just like the real ship. Titanic may start off a little slow, but it is still very engrossing, in my opinion. The second half of the movie is unforgettable. It is tense, suspenseful, and compelling. Watching this movie makes you feel like you were really on the ship. The movie does include some characters that really were on the ship, but Jack and Rose's characters are fictitious. I'm not sure how accurate the rest of the movie is, but the reality of it all is impeccable. Titanic is a riveting movie that really draws you in to the disaster and the tragedy of that night.I would certainly recommend Titanic, to all audiences. Do not listen the hype though, and do not listen to the criticism either. Just watch the movie, and make your own opinion. If you leave your cynicism at the door, then you may just discover the beauty of this movie.",7/10
My heart will go on,freemantle_uk,27 May 2020,"Titanic was a pop culture phenomenon upon its release, breaking box-office and awards records. It obviously struck a chord.Titanic was an old-fashioned romance that happened to be made by a man who used revolutionary techniques. The first half of the film was about two star-crossed lovers from different strata and the second was about the disaster. The setting was used to look at the different attitudes about class and wealth as well as tell an emotional human story. Whilst scenes of the disaster supply lots of peril and excitement.Even though Titanic was a smash hit I doubt it made today because it was over three hours long and not based on a recognisable property. Studios want franchises and avoid making films over two and half hours.",8/10

James Cameron's 1997 Titanic is easily the most overrated film in history!,MovieFanGuyy,4 June 2007,"Titanic, which is currently the biggest film of all time, (Why? is the biggest question of them all!) definitely has divided moviegoers in the last decade since it's release. Many women feel it is one of their favorite films of all time with great special effects, and a lead that they can relate to. Most men on the other hand, obviously feel very differently than women do about this film.Many others, like myself, easily feel that James Cameron's Titanic is easily the most overrated film in history with bloated, cheesy and banal dialoge, two dull lead characters, and a storyline which cheapens the tragedy of the sunken ship.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet play the star crossed lovers aboard the doomed ship, while a supporting cast with Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, and Bernard Hill do their best in trying to keep the screenplay and Cameron's bloated dialoge from falling out of place.The visual effects, which looked decent at the time has not held up well, there is a lot of pixelation of the ship itself, and the crash sequence today looks like something out of a playstation video game.The dialoge also today does not hold up well, and many sequences such as Rose holding up a middle finger does not support believability in the least. Secondly, while the two leads are treading frozen water, both of them would have died from hypothemia long before the ship itself sank to the bottom.Third, Rose's character would have died even quicker floating on top of the piece of wood since the ocean wind is actually much colder than the water itself, not to mention the water on her body would have also caused hypothemia as well. Why her character was one of the few survivors is a puzzlement to credability of this film itself.This film will continue to divide moviegoers for many years, with many of it's fans liking it, and those who despise and hate Titanic, will also continue to do so.James Cameron had a great opportunity to explore the legacy of the famed sunken ship, but instead by focusing on a teenage romance, with banal dialoge, and two wooden leads, it definitely kills not only the storyline, but the credability of this film as well.In my opinion, Titanic does not hold up well to stand the test of time, and that is why it's easily the most overrated film in history in my opinion. His last great film was 1991's T2, as both True Lies and Titanic contained much of Cameron's famously banal dialoge and bloated budgets.",1/10
More than a doomed romance,frankde-jong,24 April 2021,"Some time ago I watched ""A night to remember"" (1958, Roy Ward Baker), a film about the Titanic. This film was the direct cause to rewatch the ""ultimate"" Titanic movie of James Cameron.Both films tell of course the same story and share a number of comparable scenes (there is a you tube item where this comparison is acually made) and nonetheless the atmposhere is remarkably different. This difference is of course attributable to the romance between Rose (first class passenger played by Kate Winslet) and Jack (third class passenger played by Leonardo DiCaprio).Through this romance Cameron is able to sketch class distinctions well before the scenes in which third class passangers are denied access to the lifeboats. The distinction is most visible in the scenes in which Jack fist dines with Rose in the first class and Rose thereafter visits the dance evening in the third class.Cameron not only shows the distinction he also makes a value judgement. The first class passengers are (in majority) bad and hypocrite, the third class is on the contrary good, honest and full of life. This value judgement maybe somewhat generalising (for example the first class passenger Molly Brown (an excellent role of Kathy Bates) is rather sympathetic) but fits into the view in which the disaster with the Titanic is not just a ""traffic accident"" but symbolizes the decline of the 19th century class society and the end of the optimism at the start of the 20th century. In this symbolic view the iceberg stands for World War I.In some ways the romance between Jack and Rose is overdone. Especially Jack is too much a prince on too white a horse. In the aformentioned dinner scene he adapts remarkably well to the first class manners, while in the rest of the film Cameron stresses the unbridgeable gap between the classes. Apart from this Jack is also a capable artist, a sharp psychologist (he foresees what will happen if Rose stays with her rich but possessive fianc√©) and last but not least he knows exactly how the Titanic will collapse.Not only Jack but also the spectator knows exactly how the Titanic will collapse. Earlier in the film it was explained to the old Rose (Gloria Stuart) by a member of an expedition to the wreck of the Titanic. The romance between Jack and Rose resulted in a nude portrait of Rose and the discovery of this nude portait in a safe on the Titanic enabled Cameron to frame the story as an intelligent flashback (old Rose telling her story to the members of the crew of the expedition).On second glance I realised how smart Cameron constructed his film. The romance between Jack and Rose as a vehicle to illustrate the class society. The explanation to old Rose about the collapse of the Titanic to also inform the spectator so that he can concentrate on the human drama in scenes to come. The use of the blue Danuba from Strauss (reminding of ""2001: A space odyssey"" (1968, Stanley Kubrick)) in the scene where the first class passengers elegantly walk towards their dining table. Only the computer animations of the overwiew shots of the Titanic slightly disappointed me. They were scarcely better than the 1953 overviews (or is that a compliment to ""A night to remember""? ).""Titanic"" has grown almost synonymous with Kate Winslet and Leonardi DiCaperio. Don't forget however the supporting actresses. Kathy Bates is superb as Molly, a nouveau riche who mercilessly exposes the hypocrisy of her fellow first class passengers. Gloria Stuart, who was 86 at that time and whose performances date back to ""The old dark house"" (1932, James Whale) is a perfect old Rose.",8/10
This is the best story of all time,gopalpandey-14823,5 February 2022,"I loved Titanic movie it's soo heart touching! I've never thought that a movie can be that much perfect i mean everything was filmed in such a way that it was looking absolutely real even at ending it was very sad for me as i almost thought it's real and talking about the real tragedy that had happened in past in RMS Titanic
After watching this movie all i can say is I'm sorry may their soul RIP.",10/10
Good things in bad times,emmaricherzhagen,11 May 2023,"Not knowing what til happen a second after what's happening in the moment is crazy and it can be good but also very bad. In Titanic two people that seem nothing a like at all fall in love and it changes everything that could have happened. This movie also shows that you can get something good out of something bad. These two were about to die if they kept waiting on each other and instead of saving themselves they waited for each other. This movie also helps explain what was really happening on the ship and how separated it really was. I recommend this movie to anyone learning about Titanic or anyone just looking for a good movie with a really sweet love story. Overall, this was an amazing movie and you should watch it if you haven't!",10/10
Star Trek 5 is more enjoyable,Op_Prime,15 January 2000,"Yeah, you heard me. The worst Star Trek movie ever made is more fun to watch than this over rated piece of garbage. It is a disaster flick. Nothing more. Acting is horrible, with exception of Billy Zane who is able to do a decent job. The special effects are the only thing going for this film. I normally enjoy movies from James Cameron (Aliens, Terminator) but I found this to be horrible. And by the way, DiCaprio can't act and that's why he didn't get an Oscar for this slop. Avoid this movie at all costs and go see with entertainment value.",1/10
Overblown,Leofwine_draca,30 June 2015,"You know, I love disaster movies, and you don't get much bigger a disaster flick than TITANIC, James Cameron's magnum opus, a massively-budgeted and massively award-winning 1997 film that swept the board at the Oscars and has gone down in history as one of the most popular films ever made. Yet I only enjoyed half of it, and that's due to a problematic structure that sacrifices disaster in favour of a cheesy, sappy romance story.Cameron has always been king when it comes to technology and people interacting with it: from his early sci-fi movies to THE ABYSS and AVATAR, he's great at depicting a world where people interact with technology and use it to their advantage. When he focuses on the disaster and sinking of the ship, this is an excellent film with some very impressive special effects that really get across the scale of the disaster.When it comes to human characters, Cameron is a much less assured writer. The romance that plays out here is more unrealistic than in a cheap paperback novel and just as twee. The characters are one-dimensional, from DiCaprio's irritating commoner to Winslet's utterly unbelievable aristocrat who falls in love with him. Their romantic scenes are cringeworthy and as with the other characters they act in very modern days that would have been alien to the era. The less said about the likes of Billy Zane's cardboard cut-out villain the better.In the end, we get a film which spends the entire first hour and a half just plodding around with dumb characters before the disaster strikes, and then things pick up, although there are still lots of cheesy moments and poor dialogue. It's 2/3 romance and 1/3 disaster, and while the disaster stuff is great, the romance is execrable. A NIGHT TO REMEMBER remains the best retelling of the tragedy out there because it focused on the events of the tragedy; I feel Cameron's TITANIC does a disservice to those who lost their lives that night.",5/10
Rarely has a three hour film seemed so short. It canters.,Koli,3 January 1999,"The cinema viewer may well wonder whether there can be any real suspense when it is clear from the beginning of the film that the central character, Rose (Kate Winslet), will survive the disaster that befalls the Titanic. But suspense there is, not least because we don't know whether her lover will make it. There is also action, social (class) comment, drama, historical notes - not least several comments on the cause of the initial impact and why it was so disastrous - and good old fashioned romance.Rarely has a three hour film seemed so short. It canters. The romance at the centre of the plot develops quickly and my attention was held not only by developments in this story but the events that, taken together, spelt disaster for the 'unsinkable' ship, and then the aftermath of the ship's collision with that famous iceberg.Kate Winslet was simply gorgeous and put in a fine performance, as did Leonardo di Caprio as Jack Dawson. The make-up of the older Rose (Gloria Stuart) was one of the less convincing aspects of the movie, but it seems churlish to draw attention to such a detail; in any case, it's to be expected that an 87 year old will need a fair amount of facial recontouring and war-paint to play a woman of 101.",8/10
How much crap will we put up with?,Quentin-12,19 February 1999,"How can we live in a world where a piece of *%^@ film like Titanic can even be considered for an Academy Award?  Now I understand that I must give some credit to Mr. Cameron for spending WAY too much on minor details (such as the ships's engine) which could have easily been avoided.  This is the obvious case of a man who needs to spend as much money as possible for publicity? Anyone remember the last time that stunt was pulled?  It was called ""Waterworld"" - and was equally as bad and chessy.  The only difference was that ""Waterworld"" did not take place around a real event - and that is the ONLY reason Titanic won Best Picture, oh and how I can forget the ludicrous special effects!!!  In my humble opionion no film that isn't at least nominated for Best Screenplay should be able to take home the Best Picture award.  Mr. Cameron must have written his script after an inspiration of something he saw floating in a toilet.  I'm sorry to say this Mr. Oscar, but you've lost my respect.",No Rating

I wanted to throw things at the screen(but I didn't because it's not the screen's fault that the movie sucked). I will never understand why so many people liked this movie. I saw this movie in the theatre expecting a cinematic triumph, instead, the only emotion it evoked in me was pain because after seeing all that water I really had to pee. It was also painful because the amount of sap in that movie could fill the Hoover Dam.If I had known how repulsive this movie was before I spent $7 to see it, I would've avoided it altogether.",1/10

"There are much, much better epics out there...",Nog,12 August 2003,"Despite Cameron's showboating at the Academy Awards, this is simply a bombastic mess. His first mistake was to take on too many roles, and crucially, that of screenwriter. What flimsy story he concocted to precede the disaster is rife with bad dialog and the most tired stereotypes imaginable. Take a look at the ""Goofs"" page here, too. You would think they could have done much better; sloppy work for one of the most expensive films ever made.I felt like shouting at the screen at times: are you kidding? They spend how many minutes of the film in bone-chilling water and aren't even shivering just a little bit after getting out? (The water temperature would have to be about, what, 30 degrees? After all, there's icebergs floating in it! They would have been hypothermic within minutes, and dead after a few more.) And he gets the Best Director Award for such atrocious work?

One of Cameron's best,mrashtastic89,31 December 2021,"I've only ever seen one Cameron film (Avatar, pretty bad) but I love what Cameron made here, this film has won many awards and is considered a classic, what I am I saying that hasn't already been said?Titanic is not flawless but it is a great film, every second is beautifully filmed, the wide shots loom over the entire screen, and despite the 3 h 14 min runtime, which might seem daunting to some viewers, it's rarely a boring film.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a standout performance in this movie, his character was relatable, believable, and felt real, I was really sad at one part (not gonna spoil it) and Kate Winslet was fantastic in the film.That visual of everyone falling into the water will be burned into my brain for a long time, these visuals are horrific.Titanic is wickedly suspenseful, the entire finale is white-knuckled, some of the best suspense I've ever seen in a film, it touches on some great fears out there.It's also very, very funny, with some iconic scenes and a great musical score, I already listen to Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" and I will a lot more after this film.The special effects for the shipwreck are cutting edge, they look so real, the two characters have amazing journeys and you just get wrapped up and lost in the story.Pretty much the only negative thing I have to say about it is that some of the characters felt a little simplistic and stereotyped.I'm gonna give Titanic an A.",9/10
"Come for the CGI and the love story, Stay for the sinking",SnoopyStyle,15 December 2013,"Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) is searching for a legendary gem called The Heart of the Ocean presumed lost on the Titanic. When he finds a drawing instead, Rose (Gloria Stuart/Kate Winslet) comes on board and tells her story of Titanic and her love Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). She's a wealthy girl destined for a loveless marriage to the hateful Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). He's a wandering artist who won his Titanic ticket in a poker game. He would save her in every way that a person can be saved.I have often railed against the insertion of a love story unnecessarily into a historical event like 'Pearl Harbor'. But I think James Cameron made the right decision here. The story is compelling by itself. Leo has that boyish charm. Kate and Leo has become a legendary Hollywood big screen pairing. This time it works because it's well written, and well acted.There is the great CGI. It's relatively seamless, and ahead of its times. The engine room is magnificent, even better than the boat itself. The iceberg hit was very convincing.Then there is the sinking. For something that is absolutely expected, it still shocks. The suspense of it all holds my attention every time. The last hour of the movie is perhaps one of the most tension filled sequence of all times. It is the incredible CGI as well as the amazing stunts. It marries the real world with the computer world, and have rarely been exceeded even to this day. It is more harrowing than all those 3D superheroes smashing into skyscrapers. For it's iconic status, I have to give this 9/10.",9/10
Seen it so many times and still makes me cry.,linroberts,25 June 2023,Just finished watching this movie for the 50th time last night. Honestly I haven't seen it in years and it's still one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Not to mention how amazing the cgi was during this time. The director was definitely ahead of his time. I love the love story between Jack and Rose I feel like it puts you right on the shipped with them and kind of let you feel what it would've been like being there and having no clue about the tragedy that lied ahead. I feel like their story really helped you empathized with the people on the ship. The sinking scene was horrifying but mesmerizing at the same time.,10/10
VERY OVERRATED!!!!,lotus_chief,5 August 2003,"SPOILERS INCLUDED...Although I made a vow to myself to NEVER see this movie, my girlfriend begged me to rent it and sit through it with her.  So, very reluctantly, I did.  And let me just say, Titanic was everything I expected.  Titanic is nothing but an overly sappy, unrealistic, historically incorrect, drawn out, trashy film.  With all the hype this film received, after seeing it I expected to see Titanic on IMDB's Top 250 list...but it's not!  WHEW!! Good, because it doesn't deserve to be.  My God, WHAT WAS THE HYPE ABOUT?? Why was this movie 3 hours and 14 minutes?  That alone is a BIG flaw of this film because we all know what's going to happen in the end.... why let the audience wait 2.5 hours to see the inevitable?  This movie could've been cropped to 2.5 easily...which still maybe would've been too long.  The corny love story was just horrible.  The language used, especially by DiCaprio's character, was totally unbelievable and unconvincing....we're supposed to be in 1912, remember??  Kate Winslet came off as an annoying little brat....DiCaprio was barely tolerable.  Another thing that turned me off to the film was the story.  How could people embrace this film so much in its account of the Titanic experience... and the story is fictional?  We're supposed to take Cameron's word for it? Please!  The love story, along with the overall script he wrote was SICKENING.  The only good part of the film is when the boat starts to sink....that's the only part of the film that really matters.   
Now my major gripe with the film:  What was the deal with Rose taking up the whole door???  LOL.  Did you all see how big that door was???  You mean to tell me that Jack couldn't fit on the door with her?  She claimed she loved Jack...even went back to save him while he was chained to the pipe in that room that was flooding.  If that was the case why couldn't she make room for him to get up on the door with her instead of freezing to death in the Atlantic?? I'm curious whether anyone else has wondered that....The scene i mentioned above embodies my feelings about Titanic.  It seems Cameron just wanted to get some Oscars, so he put the formula together to do so.  Get Celine Dion to sing da song, the sappy score, put Leo in there so all da little girls would go see it and feel sorry for him, have a HUGE budget, use lots of CGI and make it a 3+ hour film (so it could be an epic of course).  it all comes across as CHEAP!  He was trying too hard to appeal to everyone...it has the sappy emotional, 'boo-hoo' aspect for the ladies and the graphic action-packed death sequences for the guys.  In the end we have 3 hours of confusion and essentially pointless narrative.  I finally sat through this film and, like I knew it would, it justified my initial thoughts of it when it first released in '97.  Corny, horrible story, and completely overdone.  Bottom line, this movie sucked, and has to be the most overrated film I've seen in a LONG, long time, maybe ever.  *1/2 out of ****.",4/10
A great film,proud_luddite,20 December 2020,"This film mixes history (the sinking of the great ship in 1912) with fiction (a story of star-crossed young lovers on the ship: one, an artist with limited income; the other yearning to abandon the stuffiness of her upper-class background and a shallow fianc√©).The 3-D re-release of this film was even more enjoyable the second time. The special effects are phenomenal. The scenes of the sinking ship are perfectly orchestrated and some images can't leave the mind such as the many bodies in the sea after the sinking. Seeing this film after 2001 is eerie; scenes of people jumping off the ship are reminiscent of the destruction of the World Trade Centre.The love story in the first half works well - mainly because of the fine work by actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Kathy Bates also makes the most of a small role.This is not to say the film is without flaws in the story. Did people really use the middle-finger gesture back in 1912? A rescue scene was perfectly directed but was also far-fetched. Also, the modern-day character who narrates the story in flashback fails to say what happened to one of her relatives.The story does well in exposing the injustices imposed by the upper-class whose descendants would be called ""the one per cent"" a century later. Their stuffiness is also exposed with good humour. But sometimes, the soullessness seems exaggerated.But these flaws don't dilute the great impact of this film. James Cameron's best work is in his directing rather than his writing. This is one of the rare big-budget Hollywood films of the past three decades that truly lives up to its expectations of greatness. - dbamateurcriticRating: 9 out of 10Award-Worth Achievements:

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet shine as our doomed hero and heroine. In a comeback performance, Gloria Stuart does very well in the part of Winslet as an old woman.What is so enjoyable about this film is the sociological depiction of the upper and lower classes. We can see from almost the beginning of the disaster, the lower class will be doomed to tragedy.Frances Fisher gives excellent support as Kate's upper class mean mother. This is a mother so mean that Kate went through life never revealing to her that she had survived.Di Caprio, it has been argued, looked too young for the part.

(Watching it free is the only way to see this wretched excess without giving the studio hacks behind it the wrong idea, that it might have been worth making - it wasn't.) Anyway, I thought the people freezing took an awful long time going to meet their maker.

"A beautiful, horrifying masterpiece",Shay17,23 August 2020,"I have watched Titanic a number of times. The first being in the cinema in 1997, and the most recent last night (2020).It just never fails to move me in many ways. The disgust you feel at the egotistim and treatment of lower classes as well as the deeply engaging stories of those who were destined to be a part of history (in more ways than they ever bargained for), and the final abject terror watching the boat's demise makes this film a true rollercoaster of emotion.While the love story between Jack and Rose is fictional, and does take some 'Hollywood' artistic license, it adds a depth a richness to the story to allow you to empathise with many of the passengers on board. Watching it now, as a mother of young children, the Irish mother telling a fairytale to her two children as the ship is going down is infinitely heartbreaking in a way I didn't fully relate to the first time (I was 14). I think that is what makes this a timeless classic.The absolutely stunning cinematography of the ship's pride and beauty, intertwined with a great storyline full of interesting characters and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack culminating in the ship's final dramatic and horrific hours still stands up 23 years later and always leaves me emotional and breathless. If you didn't know Titanic's true story, you'd be forgiven for thinking this was a far-fetched, over-egged Hollywood action film! For me, knowing it's a pretty close re-enactment of how the ship actually sank makes it all the more horrific to watch.I feel it would be easy for the next generations (particularly since the last survivor has passed on) to view the Titanic disaster as just another event in history, but I will encourage my children to watch this film not only because it's an enjoyable story, but to give them a true sense of empathy and compassion for the fellow humans that were part of the real version.",9/10

They could not have chosen anyone better than Leonardo DiCaprio( he is gorgeous) and Kate Winslet to play jack and rose. They played those characters with so much heart and feeling that it almost seemed like real life. You could tell they really gave it their all and I cried like a baby at the end. And the music My heart will go on by Celine Dion was the PERFECT song for this movie. It just really moves you.

"Cameron's 'folly' pays off big; ""Titanic"" star-making turns by Di Caprio & Winslet",george.schmidt,23 April 2003,"TITANIC (1997) **** Leonardo Di Caprio, Kate Winslet, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart, Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, Suzi Amis, Frances Fisher, Victor Garber, David Warner. The most expensive film ever made and worth every penny (some $200 million!) that now ranks the international blockbuster box office champ in cinema history ($600 million plus!!) : filmmaker James Cameron's labor of love and exquisite depiction and detail obsession pays off in a monumental way in his fictional account of the infamous/tragic maiden (and doomed, final) voyage of the S.S. Titanic focusing on star-crossed lovers (Di Caprio in his star-confirming turn as a steerage passenger and Winslet as a very proper young lady engaged to wealthy cad Zane, all by the way perfect) facing the ultimate tale of survival as the vast ship of luxury and riches slowly begins to sink thanks to its fated collision with an iceberg in The North Sea.Seamlessly edited footage of actual size set of the vessel, digital computer generated effects and visuals of the remains of the real Titanic at the bottom of the ocean eerily woven into a tapestry of visceral impact and execution. The last third of the film of the sinking, mostly in real time, is unforgettable. Cameron pulls off the impossible with perfection despite the odds of being lambasted for the largesse of the film's budget (ironically like the Titanic's own criticism for size over substance).

Two Movies for the Price of One -- Too Bad Only One of Them Is Decent,evanston_dad,16 July 2009,"""Titanic"" is really two movies: one of them is an exciting, James Cameron-style action film, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" with better special effects; the other is a dull as dirt period romance, so simplistic and clich√© it seems like something conceived in the mind of a twelve-year-old girl.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet became household names because of their performances in this, and they do invest the film with a great deal of spunk, but they've got absolutely terrible material to work with. Cameron is clearly no writer, but he is a good director of action, so just tune in to this one once the big ship has actually hit the iceberg, and you'll save yourself a lot of time.The supporting cast includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Frances Fisher as Winslet's uptight and aristocratic mother, Victor Garber as the skipper..er...captain, and Billy Zane, in an embarrassingly awful role as the movie's villain. The character as written is like something out of a silent movie, and Zane plays him as such -- if he had a mustache, he'd be twirling it. Too bad his performance is completely at odds with the totally contemporary performances of just about everyone else.Cameron reveals an almost fetishistic obsession with recreating the glamour of the famed ocean liner, and the glee with which he then goes about demolishing it and the people on it borders on the disturbing. It's like watching a little boy build an elaborate train set just so he can have the pleasure of blowing it up with firecrackers.Grade: B",6/10

In the words of Jay Sherman... it stinks!,Elerad,31 December 1998,"Alright... where to begin. This is.. without a doubt.. the most over hyped movie I have ever seen. All I can figure, is that either the academy is full of teenage girls who swooned over DiCaprio, or James Cameron threatened to smash everyone with his oversized head if they didn't give him all the awards. The characters in this movie were there only to look good and smile broadly whenever the camera focused on them. And as for the award winning effects, they didn't look remotely realistic. They were so obviously computer generated. Shame on the academy for not giving the Oscars to LA Confidential with its vastly superior cast and in depth storyline",1/10

And Titanic is about an old woman's memory about a huge famous boat and her lover she met during her endless trip to America. The first time I watched this film was in my early age. And some precious memory of my own happened during that time. Maybe this is the most important part of the movie to myself.",10/10
epic romance doomed to fail,lark40,6 February 2015,well this movie blows everything literally out of the water basically its 3hrs of epic partitions of James Cameron all time tearjerker that surprised every one in the cinema that lasted 12months what a film showing the heart of the ocean following the story of an old lady who fell in love when young her heart was with jack and she never let go even though she married some one else jack and rose were separated by a social class she was caught in between but as faith would have it the would meet for a brief but amazing romance only to be halted by ice this tear jerker would have you crying from beginning to end its such a a epic film ten out of ten great acting it deserved its 11 Oscars the determination and courageous people who died in the titanic shows through in making this movie and the actors in this film you can see some of them wanted to help the people in the water but all were frozen only few survived what a shock that titanic went down and celine dion song made this film soundtrack amazing spectale,10/10
One of the Best movies of all time,patstaciemcgue,3 January 2015,I saw this movie in the theatre's back in 1997 and remembered it as a brilliant movie. The cinematic experience was one of the best of my life even though the story is tragic and very sad. I recently watched this film with my 13 year old daughter. The magic is still there. This is still one of the best movies of all time and perhaps the greatest love story of all time. The new blue ray release is fantastic and James Horner's score is still timeless. Great job James Cameron...for producing a once in a lifetime film. Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet were fantastic in this film and both deserved best actor/actress awards.Don't be afraid to bring this one back out people... its still a beautiful epic that will stand the test of time.,10/10
Why they don't produce good movies anymore?,georgefox-06333,27 July 2020,This is a great movie from beginning to end. Everyone in it is fabulous.

Please bring back these kind of movies to the theaters.,10/10

An epic film.,theshadow908,15 September 2006,"Titanic is the most famous ""fictional story tied into real event"" movie to date. It tells the story of a poor man who wins tickets to board the Titanic in a poker game. He and his friend board the ship in hopes of reaching New York City and starting life anew. While on board, he falls for a rich woman who is set to be married. After he saves her life, she begins to fall for him, and a passionate love story begins. However, their plans are halted abruptly when the ship hits an iceberg and begins to sink. Now it's a race against time to try and get off the ship as soon as possible.I don't care what anyone has to say about this movie. Sure, the first hour is chick flick material, and it features the clich√©d rich girl/poor boy formula, but this movie is so well made, well acted, and well directed, that it deserves all the praise it gets. The movie has a 3 hour running time, but it's never really slow. Even in the sappy scenes, you're drawn in by the amazing set around the characters. James Cameron did a great job directing this movie. The recreation of the interior of the Titanic is amazing. It's like they're filming inside the real ship. Though the first hour is mainly a love story, it still can keep the guys entertained because it's not a long drawn out drama. Cameron keeps amazing balance between continuing the love story and telling the story of the disaster in the second half of the film. The sinking scenes are fantastic. Finally, the most accurate portrayal of the Titanic's demise on film. This movie has drama, action, and some comedy. It manages to tell a great story and be a highly entertaining action film at the same time.The performances are very good. Not one performance in this movie is flawed. Everybody involved is extremely talented and they all do very well in their parts.Overall, despite what anyone says about this movie, it doesn't change the fact that it's an epic film with a great story and amazing visuals.9/10",9/10

"The Blandest, Stupidest Account Possible of One of the Biggest Disasters in History",d-l-polonsky,12 May 2012,"The producers and writers of Titanic obviously believed they'd bore and alienate the targeted teen and twenty-something audience to the point of losing them if the characters had the attitudes, mannerisms and style of speech that was appropriate for the time, so they had Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslett) speaking contemporary dialogue in a contemporary style, or at least contemporary for '97. A young man in 1912 would not say, ""You seem more like an indoor girl."" Aside from a certain hostile type of mental patient or the most outrageous and anti-social bohemian agitator, young adults in 1912 did not repeatedly tell their elders to shut up. The creators of the film are counting on what they perceive to be the teen and young adult's lack of knowledge or interest in the values and social customs of the very early 20th century. Since they want the audience to get swept away by the drama and romance of Jack and Rose they want them to relate to everything about them. I remember that this was billed as somewhat of a a fantasy re-imagining of a real event, but this type of historical revisionism, I think, in which human behavior is simply made more familiar, is an insult to any viewer with a 3-digit I.Q. One continuity problem that really gets me is how, when the ship is sinking and Jack and Rose are still inside, the water level is lower and the water becomes calmer around them every time they have a conversation. Again, the makers of the film don't want the reality of the disaster to encroach on, or distract us from, the passionate young romance they're trying to draw us into. Clearly the creators of the film think that the romance is a bigger draw for a major segment of the audience than the story of an enormous disaster that killed over 1,500 people and I'm sure they're right, but often when true and fictional stories exist in the same movie, one weakens the impact of the other, and it's certainly true in this case. I haven't seen the new 3D version but I assume the only change is the 3D effect. This is a bland, pandering, intelligence-insulting and epically overrated epic.",1/10
the best movie ever made,quinn18,2 August 2005,"Why did this movie made 600million dollars at the box office?it's because you people loved it.Why is this movie only rate 6.9 out of 10?It's because 10 000 people in the world didn't like it and those 10 000 votes on IMDb and the hole world would've voted on IMDb for titanic this movie would've been and 8.8 out of 10.Why is this movie not in the top 250?Well because there is not enough voters on IMDb.I don't know why people didn't like this wonderful masterpiece.Maybe because you don't like love stories and who ever doesn't shouldn't of watch this one then and go do bad comments on it.And maybe people didn't like it because it is a remake, well get over it, I like this one way more then the 1953 version and plus I like all the remakes because if Iwonna watch Walking tall well I have the choice between the good one or the bad oneI don't know why people didn't like the story.I think the story is great there could'nt of been a better one that shows the gigantic boat (titanic) sink in the middle of the Atlantic.Every thing is wonderful about this movie, the actors,the characters, the music, the visual effects, the scenery, and every thing else.Leonardo DiCaprio should've gotten en award for his great performance and Kate Winslet should've gotten one too.",10/10
A good three-hour epic from James Cameron!,joshuadrake-91275,22 September 2015,"This is going to be a short review for Titanic.Plot: The plot of the film is really amazing. If you want a three-hour long love story, this is the movie for you. Another movie worth watching is ""A Walk to Remember"", starring Mandy Moore and it is a movie that I have seen and it is spectacular. The entire 196-minute picture centers around two lovers: one rich girl named Rose DeWitt Bukater and poor artist Jack Dawson (portrayed nicely by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio) as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during it's ill-fated maiden voyage.Characters and Story: James Cameron wrote a story that shines out, but the dialogue is very clich√©d and cheesy in a few areas. The characters are all well portrayed and I give to the two main actors, also credit to Billy Zane, who plays Cal, he is the character you want to hate. Kathy Bates, Bernard Hill, Frances Fisher, Johnathan Hyde, Danny Nucci, David Warner, Bill Paxton and the late Gloria Stuart, who plays older Rose in this film and she should have deserved an Oscar.Visuals: This is where the movie shines. James Cameron wanted to make a movie about the Titanic and it shows, with it's $200 million dollar budget and he made this movie historically accurate as possible. The ship's sinking scene is one of the coolest thing they could do with CGI and practical effects and it is awesome.Sound / Music: The music is awesome and fantastic. James Horner composed a musical score and he is fantastic. The film's theme song, ""My Heart Will Go On"", performed by Celine Dion and I love it and a lot of people has did covers of this song and I listen to this version and it was fantastic.Enjoyment: TITANIC is a good classic, epic romantic disaster film that I have no problem watching once in a while. The film won 11 Oscars including Best Director, Best Picture and Best Original Song. It made $2 billion dollars worldwide and it is just fantastic. 10/10.",10/10
Fabulous direction by James Cameron,Aydonis1981,12 February 2023,"Just saw 'Titanic 3D' in the cinema (IMAX)...The subsequent 3D conversion doesn't bring any real added value, but the story - after 25 years - touched me even more than it did then; I saw the movie in the cinema for the first time today and 'Titanic' is, just before 'Braveheart', (in my eyes) the most beautiful love story on screen (James Horner's great music of course also does a lot), while the second half of the film with top tension, great action and dramatic scenes still knows how to captivate today...Whatever some people may think of James Cameron, he is quite simply the ultimate director god of the last decades!",9/10
The only film to ever make me cry,elainehowie,14 June 2018,"Titanic is 3 hours long yet managed to keep me captivated the entire time. You can clearly see the effort put into this masterpiece. Basically everything about the film is amazing: the visuals, the characters and the story in general. I love how the story cut between the past and the present. The actresses of both old and young Rose are amazing. Practically all of the actors put on a dazzling performance, even the extras. The first part of the film for the most part generates positive feelings, even though you know what's going to happen. The part where the ship sinks creates powerful emotions, as the film really involves you and makes you feel like you were a part of it. The film also makes you become attached to the characters. These scenes are deeply upsetting, and this film is the only film that I have cried during due to how realistic it is and that the fact that you know this really happened. Overall, this film is beautifully done and is fully deserving of all the high praise it has gained. It makes you feel all kinds of emotions and is definitely a film of the ages.",10/10
This was a long long movie--Spoiler Alert,stormhappy106,22 December 2014,"OK, the last hour was great, technically speaking--The people running up and down the ship, the lifeboats, the ship cracking up, and when one of the huge smokestacks falls onto the passengers in the water, the visual and sound effects were incredible--That is the best scene in the film, and one of the best scenes in movie history.BUT, the miscasting of Leonardo was a huge mistake--Leonardo looks like a schoolboy, and a funny-looking one at that, with his beady little eyes--There is nothing remotely ""manly"" or ""heroic"" about this little twerp. Everyone else in the film was fine, especially all the British Actors.Until the iceberg actually hits, you will be bored out of your mind, despite the impressive recreation of the boat's interior and clothes of the cast.Please watch A NIGHT TO REMEMBER(1958) instead.",3/10

Tragedy and Love. An True Holllywood Epic.,blazesnakes9,3 July 2011,"One of the well-known ships that became an disaster at sea was the Titanic. It sank in 1912 on its voyage out to sea. Disaster struck when the ship hits an iceberg and cause it to sink. The passengers of the Titanic were trying to survive. Many of them died. Some of them were in lifeboats. Now, James Cameron brings back the mighty ship. In his film Titanic, a man named Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He goes on the Titanic after winning an poker game. Also on board an beautiful passenger, played by Kate Winslet and her fianc√©, played by Billy Zane. DiCaprio and Winslet fall for each other in love as the Titanic ventures out to sea. Then, the iceberg hits the Titanic and that is when chaos begins. Passengers are frightened as the ship slowly starts to sink. The ship's sinking isn't about the passengers screaming and panicking, but it gives an realistic dramatization of the ship. Real documentary footage of the real Titanic appear on the opening credits. Winslet's character Rose, now old, is played by Gloria Stuart, who remembered what happen that night. The movie's visionary of the Titanic sinking is wonderful made with the special effects. As for Winslet and DiCaprio, they have great performances as Rose and Jack. The film itself is a tragedy of what happened. Titanic is one of the best films of 1997. An great, true Hollywood Epic. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 4 stars.",10/10
A rich and immortal tapestry. Bravo,The_Stuff_of_Dreams,8 October 2009,"Say what you will about the gooey love story, but do not contest the film being a masterpiece. Never has a film inspired such emotion in me, such a feeling of belonging to the thrills and struggles of the characters on the screen. The music, a rich blend of instrumental and vocal, is far from archaic. It inspires emotional power that would have otherwise been lost. The story is obviously well-researched, the images are heartbreaking and breathtaking, and, unlike many epics, Titanic is not arrogant, and it does not drag on. In fact, despite its being one of the longest movies I have ever seen, it felt rushed. It was over too soon. It was that good. I did not even think that the love story was that distracting from the grandeur. It was just another human aspect masterfully explored by the film: greed, hate, panic, and, above all, love, a love so profound, so passionate, that it should inspire viewers with envy, not laughter. No, Titanic is as close to flawless as anything can get. With characters that should rightfully be hated and loved, characters to whom we can all relate, a recapture of the world of the past and the ship itself synonymous to a time machine, and a story replete with comedy, tragedy, and thrill, Titanic is a classic that time can never erode, and that shall always inspire laughter and tears.",10/10
First half is slushy and unconvincing love story. Second half is an extraordinary and powerful sinking sequence.,barnabyrudge,7 January 2005,"Titanic is a staggeringly expensive and elegant love story, set against one of the most shocking maritime tragedies in history. Prior to its release, the media had their knives out for director James Cameron and were poised like vultures to cut him down to size. The budget had spiralled out-of-control, the film was scheduled with a running time of 3 hours, and everyone predicted a critical and financial disaster of unprecedented magnitude. As it turns out, Titanic is actually a good film. Not an excellent film, which many people seem to suggest, but definitely a good film. The second half in particular, which deals with the sinking of the ship and the chaos and panic that sweeps through the passengers, is very well made cinema.In the present, treasure hunters discover aboard the wreckage of the Titanic a drawing of a naked woman wearing a priceless diamond necklace. An old lady named Rose (Gloria Grahame) sees the drawing on the TV news. She calls in immediately, claiming that she is the woman in the picture. Rose is flown out to the dive centre in the Atlantic, where she narrates the story of how she came to be the subject of the drawing. She tells how a penniless American youth, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), won a ticket onto the Titanic during a card game in Southampton. She tells how she as a young woman (Kate Winslet) was travelling in first-class with her fianc√©e, banker Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), and how the two of them were unhappy in their relationship. Gradually, Jack - an aspiring artist - and Rose came together and began to fall in love. Then, the unthinkable happened and the Titanic hit an iceberg....For 90 minutes or so, Titanic almost lives down to the disastrous reputation that had been predicted of it before its release. It is a naive, slushy romantic story in which the love affair that develops is unconvincing and unbelievable. The characters of Rose, Jack and Cal are lifted straight from the pages of a Barbara Cartland-style, clich√©d love-and-passion romance. But the film dramatically improves once the iceberg strikes. Cameron is into more comfortable territory at this point, showing his dazzling technical talents and his mastery of spectacle and excitement in a prolonged sinking sequence of true quality. The film suddenly becomes more purposeful and urgent, more exciting and moving. For upwards of an hour, we witness an authentic and harrowing event from a perspective of remarkable realism.Titanic eventually emerged as a phenomenally successful film, and recouped all its budgetary outlay plus a whole lot more. It also made the critics eat the words of their negative predictions. Yes, the opening stretch isn't up to much..... but the ship-sinking sequence more than compensates, and transforms this into a very commendable film.",7/10
I wanted the ship to sink within 20 minutes of the start of the film!,mikehamilton,27 May 2001,"The tragedy here was the fact that they took what could have been a great film/story and turned it into a typical piece of Hollywood Crud!  Seriously, the acting totally sucked!  The screenplay was trite and boring.  The contrived scenes with the old Rose (not to mention with all the other characters) were so sad, this piece of garbage could only come from small minds that merely used a bunch of special effects to mask the poorly written script!  Sad, Sad, Sad.........  I know that I'm certainly not in the majority on this one, obviously by the actual take on boxoffice and video rental/sales, but I know that I can tell good acting from affected, contrived, crud - and this certainly was full of the latter!

A Timeless Epic,baileycrawly,13 July 2020,"There isn't much that can be said about James Cameron's Titanic that hasn't been said by the cast & crew, the audiences or the hours upon hours of bonus content that accompanies every release of the film for the last 15 years.Titanic is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The sets are gorgeous and look exactly like the images of the Titanic, James Horner's score perfectly compliments the stunning visuals and tone throughout the film, the acting (particularly, of course, from Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) is second to none, the camera work James Cameron does throughout the movie helps to make the movie feel truly epic and heartbreaking. It's a perfectly balanced film that features a spontaneous love connection (with the chemistry to match it), but also doesn't take away from the truly tragic elements of the Titanic.It's a movie that is both sensationalized to suit Hollywood and the film-going public of its time and sensitive to the reality of its subject matter when it needs to be. It's like there's a switch that is flipped, as soon as the very real and horrific events of the Titanic begin to transpire on the screen, it switches to a reflection of the tragedy of the time in a respectful manner. The love and admiration James Cameron has for the ship is extremely evident as the film goes on, and he managed to craft a perfectly balanced story.It's an endearing film and a great way to ensure that the public always remembers what happened on the RMS Titanic. Of all the film adaptations (live-action and animated) that exist, this one is definitely the definitive, go-to version. It holds your interest with its perfect pacing and leaves you on the edge of your seat.",9/10
Exceptional,reamaboucharaf,19 February 2019,"The tale of the ill-fated, unsinkable, R.M.S. Titanic is a tale we all know too well, but could not have been illustrated more beautifully.

The two of the strongest performances ever given by DiCaprio and Winslet, that it still remains unforgettable almost 25 years later. The gut wrenchingly beautiful score by James Horner is one of the film's crucial elements, displaying a whole new realm of emotions with every note. This film is deserving of all of its success, and will forever be a classic, timeless, and celebrated masterpiece.",10/10

An Injustice To The Survivors,Niro,30 January 2000,"Any human being who considers ""Titanic"" to be among the top 250 films of all time should be strapped to a chair in a small room and be forced to watch any Tom Cruise vehicle several hundred times.  In pan 'scan format.Like so many awful Best Picture winners which came before it, ""Titanic"" does a horrible injustice to its so-called intended ""heroes""... in this case, by stereotyping them, making them dispensible.The most recent B.P. winner to have borrowed this technique is Costner's aberration, ""Dances With Wolves,"" which pretended to be about the plight of the Native Americans, whose country we literally stole from them, and turning it into a fable about how one __white__ man rises above his equals to ""appreciate"" the former.  See ""Black Robe,"" ""Little Big Man"" or ""Soldier Blue"" instead.The politically~correct ""Driving Miss Daisy"" suffers the same fate: it should be about Freeman's character, which is infinitely more interesting than Tandy's.""Forrest Gump"" is nearly as insulting, by changing the book in such away as to take the worst of Gump's traits and failings and foisting them on the Robin Wright Penn's ""Jenny"" character, leaving sweet Forrest a saint and Jenny a slut.  ""Pulp Fiction,"" also released in 1994 has already had a greater effect on filmmaking than ""Gump"" ever will.And __that's__ not even Tarantino's best film!Despicable.While we're at it, let's add to this list of garbage which has recently won Best Picture: Mel Gibson's lamentable ""Braveheart,"" which, while sporting excellent large~scale battle scenes, is nearly entirely fictional.More proof that Hollywood's elite still like guys who've paid their dues in front of the camera.""Gandhi""???  Don't even get me started on that Best Costume Design Oscar, let alone its B.P.The trend may have begun in 1939, with the single most overrated flick of all time [""Gone With The Wind"" of course] beating out at least seven better films made in the same year.~Niro",1/10
"""Titanic"" in Every Sense of the Word",xiaoli7377,6 August 2022,"What really stands out to me is the high value production that is still very impressive to me twenty-five years after the movie set sail. Great special effects that combine some (admittedly dated) CGI effects with huge sets and dozens of extras that all make the movie a marvel to witness. Truly a movie that deserves to be scene on the big screen and not on television.Unfortunately my main gripe comes with, as many have also pointed out over the years, a bit of a generic social class-based romance plot. A lot of the scenes are nice, and Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have great chemistry (being both stars' breakout roles), but it really comes down the execution being a bit of a bore and little substance here. I would have liked to see some more light shed on the crew's perspective; the panic realizing that there was nothing to be done and the desperate measures taken to ensure the survival of some of the passengers. Also some more story on the Carpathia finding the life boats and their response to the distress signals. The aftermath of the news breaking out to the rest of the world. Stuff like that.A good movie but lacking just a tad in the storytelling department; I would have gladly eschewed the romantic plot for one that placed more emphasis as a disaster thriller.",8/10
"This movie will make you laugh, cry, and learn all in one!",airwin-35946,31 August 2015,"Even though some of the actual events did not occur in reality as portrayed in the film, I feel as if the film portrayed the events to the best of their ability. I thought that the film did a good job of displaying the hardships and diversity between social classes. The character's interactions and emotions about the situations and conflicts they were faced with were also depicted well. Leonardo DiCaprio (one of my favorite actors) and Kate Winslet play amazing roles as Jack and Rose, and they do it justice! The connection and relationship between the two is a story in itself within the film as well as the ship's tragedy.As a young girl I watched this movie many many times with my grandmother. After watching it so much I became obsessed with learning about the Titanic. To this day I still enjoy doing research about the actual ship, the people aboard, the engineers who built the ship, the accident, the aftermath, and what is still being found in the bottom of the Atlantic.

A brilliantly assembled mishmash of movie clihes-wonderful!,ianlouisiana,24 July 2007,"""Titanic"",like ""Gone with the wind"" is one of the great unrateable movies. Just as GWTW caught the imagination of the public in its time so ""Titanic"" repeated the feat sixty years later.Neither one of them is a ""great"" movie in the artistic or intellectual sense,but both of them are great movies in terms of sheer populist entertainment and their grasp of the mood of the moment.Possibly even ""opportunist"" might be the right word. Both of them had huge lead roles and nothing much else for their actors,both featured highly unlikely romances between people from different social stratas.GWTW had the burning of Atlanta,brilliant state - of - the - art filming,and ""Titanic"" has the sinking of the ship which is hugely impressive by any standards. Ten years down the line it looks better to me than it did on it's release. Mr L. diCaprio,a little like a mixture of James Cagney and Mickey Rooney, is feisty and funny as Jack,Kate Winslet full of vitality and a slightly knowing innocence,hold the film together during its occasional longeurs,and their coupling is sweet and funny if highly unlikely. Forget all the ""buts"" and allow yourself to be swept along,lingering in the chandeliered dining rooms, strolling the endless decks and watch the stokers toil in the massive engine rooms like Dore's vision of Hell. The whole thing is a brilliantly assembled mish - mash of movie clich√©s one following the other seamlessly so that you don't care that you're watching sheer corn because it's so well done. The opening sequence with the 102 year - old Rose on the Diving ship is patiently built up with gradually lengthening flashbacks to 1912. The ending, where Rose,after telling her story goes out on the deck in the middle of the night and lets the priceless diamond she has had all along slip into the ocean then........no,on the remote chance that you haven't seen the movie I won't go any further.But I will pay the ultimate tribute to Mr Cameron and confess that I have watched ""Titanic"" six times and every damn time,no matter how much I tell myself I am being manipulated by a succession of still photographs being projected at just the right speed to cause persistence of vision..........I cry. Furthermore I would say that anybody not similarly affected would not feature highly on my Christmas Card list. This is film - making of the highest order and I take my hat off to everybody involved.",9/10
The only entertaining thing about this movie is the seasickness it will induce.,Sam_Youno,11 October 2006,"Pure glop. Wooden acting. Astonishingly unconvincing characters. Boring, generic music (descending to banality in the case of ""My Heart Will Go On""). Good sets and effects (no surprise, considering how much money was spent on them). Overall, the cinematic equivalent of a Big Mac, but even more tasteless.The first time I watched ""Titanic,"" I lasted 20 minutes. ""I'm going upstairs to read,"" I told my wife. ""Call me when it starts to sink."" The sinking was lots of fun (that, and the effects, are why I rate it a 2 instead of a 1), but not enough to counteract three hours of turgid, sentimental ooze. If the film had BEGUN with the sinking scene, it would rate a 10.I did watch it again, in its entirety, and that's three and a quarter hours of my life that I will never get back.",2/10
"The Best Epic Film Since Ben-Hur. A timeless, moving classic that needs to be acknowledged!",mviedirctr,11 August 2009,"This is EXACTLY what I think: It annoys me when people say they don't like this movie. Yes, it might not be a masterpiece but this was a damn good cinematic achievement. Ben-Hur has a higher rating than this and it's about a man and his encounter with Jesus. If they have an epic with Jesus mentioned that is IN the IMDb top 250, then they should have this movie in the Top 250. This was a very realistic movie. Yes, James Cameron might have stretched some issues but they are very plausible.I always tear up when the music gets intense (anyone who has seen this, will know what I mean) or when I hear the Academy Award winning song that was in this movie (My Heart Will Go On) I tear up. This is the ONLY movie that has made me cry. I don't think I'll find another epic like this that'll make me cry.I've watched about 3/4 of all the movies in the Top 250 and at the very least HALF of them are unworthy of the place they are in. Hell, about a third of what I watched ought not to be on this list but maybe 150 places above the Bottom 100 and that's me being nice.People just have to watch this movie with ABSOLUTELY NO BIASED OPINION or preconceived notion that they heard it was bad. That's how I came to love it. It's now my favorite movie of all time.The effects are the best I've seen since the epics of the 50s. The acting was brilliant and Gloria Stuart should have won Best Supporting Actress for Old Rose. Hell, Kathy Bates should have grabbed a nomination at least. Not a win, but just a nomination. Maybe Victor Garber should have gotten a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The same with Jonathan Hyde. That's how believable I think this was. The second movie to win 11 Oscars in cinematic history and THE highest grossing movie of all time. This ought to be right up there in the ratings with Ben-Hur.People have to think twice about the rating they gave it and give it a higher rating. That's my opinion. I don't care what anybody thinks about it, it is just out there. Like it or hate it, think twice on this movie before giving it a low rating.15/10! That's what I believe.",10/10
"Titanic sinks, but merchandise and movie floats.",Jerique,29 October 2007,"We start off this epic classic with Mr. Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) in search of the Heart Of the Ocean necklace that would be found in the Titanic wreckage. After failing to find it and revealing so on television, Rose (Gloria Stuart), a survivor calls up Brock to go for visit.Rose quickly gets into the story of her experience on Titanic. We travel back in time to when Rose was young (Kate Winslet). Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an aspiring artist who wins himself and his friend, Fabrizio (Danny Nucci), tickets on Titanic. Almost instantly, Jack falls for Rose - regardless of her being with Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).One night, Rose runs to the back of the boat. She leans off the rail ready to jump into the waters below - hopefully to her death. Jack sees her doing this and talks her out of it. Just as he is about to pull her in, she slips. He does bring her back over, but not before Cal has come to the rescue. Jack is seen as a hero and is invited to dinner the following night.Rose begins to have feelings for Jack and they also begin to see each other frequently. Rose poses nude for Jack, wearing only the Heart Of the Ocean. They are chased by Lovejoy (David Warner) but eventually get away and make love in a storage room, inside a vehicle.I am not one for movies that go over 180 minutes, but this one has always been an exception for the reasons of it not feeling like three hours and for it being a romance. Leonardo DiCaprio is not a favourite of mine. I hated him in almost anything else, so it's safe to say that I think this is his best performance.Kate Winslet was a no-name at this point and that was on purpose, but she was quickly noticed after this for such an amazing performance. It's no wonder why she was nominated for an Oscar. She is just so easy to fall in love with.James Cameron wrote and directed this masterpiece and does anyone wonder why it won 11 Oscars, and made $1.8 billion? It deserves all the praise it gets simply because it is an epic romance movie. The only epic romance I know. The score is just magnificent and it easily put James Horner on the map.It had a great supporting cast: Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, Victor Garber, and Jonathan Hyde. The dialogue between Rose and Jack is sweet and warm-hearted. The action during the last hour is what really makes this so epic. The romance itself is fairy tale.The special effects are also stunning. I can't think of any flaws in this movie which is why I obviously give it a perfect score. Any romantic person will love this. Any couple should watch this together because it certainly speaks to you in that sense.I don't know if there is another movie out there in this genre that compares to Titanic. Which is why I recommend everyone to watch this.",10/10
"A long, monotonous, piece of epic trash",Nick_Milligan,29 April 2000,"Titanic is an over-hyped, over-rated piece of garbage. It goes an hour too long and winds on for what seems like decades. The plot is a poorly written, romantic piece of rubbish and the performances by DeCaprio and Winslet are mediocre. However, Billy Zane and Kathy Bates bring some some hope to the non-existent story line. Putting the plot and acting aside, Titanic is a technical milestone. The sequences where the Titanic sinks are nothing short of mind-blowing and you would think you are on the ship. It is lucky that the sinking of the ship is so brilliant, because after the length of time the viewer has to wait, it is much deserved. All in all, this is a movie that should have sunk in an hour and a half.",7/10
"Lacks convincing dialogue, performances and narrative leaving the CGI, which is impressive but is dating already",bob the moo,14 October 2007,"Rose DeWitt Bukater is a beautiful young woman, travelling to America to be married to the dashing cad that is Caledon Hockley. Jack Dawson is a poor Irish kid with little hope of getting to the land of plenty ¬ñ until, that is, he wins tickets onto a ship making that very crossing in mere minutes. Jack and his friend rush onto the boat and find themselves in 3rd class with all the rest of the poor people. Meanwhile, on the upper decks, the rich enjoy the space and pleasure that comes with privilege but yet Rose feels little happiness about her loveless prospects. A chance meeting between Jack and Rose sees them fall into a passionate instant love affair but time will show them that the class divide between them is really the least of their concerns.As others have mentioned, Titanic seems to have enjoyed great praise and great abuse. When it came out it was the biggest movie of the day, sitting at the top of the charts for months and also sweeping the Best Picture Academy Award for that year. However as time has gone on it has received more and more of a kicking from viewers and it has now lost a lot of the appeal and shine that it once had. To some this is just a simple backlash without basis but I'm not sure I agreed with that. Of course there is an element of wanting to tear down the ""success"" of the film and perhaps wipe that smug smile off James ""king of the world"" Cameron's face but for me a lot of the negativity comes from people seeing the film in the cold light of day, without the crowded cinema, without the hype, without the partner to hug up to while watching.So it is with me here. The first time I watched it I was with my partner in the front room of a packed cinema and allowed myself to be carried along by the sheer spectacle and not worry too much about the finer points. However watching it again I viewed it like I would any other film. As such the failings came tumbling out. The story is consistently weak whether it is the speed and superficiality of the central ""relationship"" or the roundly average dialogue within the script. Funny how a rush to sex is seen as romantic when it occurs in the movie whereas if the same tale was set in a Bolton nightclub, the view would not be the same! Part of the reason for this is the forced emotion and atmosphere of the film, with James Horner's manipulative score constantly on hand to tell us ""you're meant to cry at this bit"". This is very different from bringing the audience into the characters and the story in a genuine way and you are not getting into this car because you want to so much as being forced in with a hood over your head.Of course this is not so different from many Hollywood blockbuster, but it is particularly noticeable here because the script and characters are so lacking. Director Cameron cannot make up for the failings of writer Cameron and instead just injects as much of this manipulative schmaltz into proceedings as he can as he waits for his effects budget to kick in. When it eventually does there is no denying that it is impressive in terms of spectacle but I do wonder how this will hold up as the effects become ordinary, because there is little else for the viewer to feast on. Certainly the performances offer very little, mostly due to the material handed to them. DiCaprio is miscast. I know it has been said countless times before but he looks far too young for the part and, as he looks more adult in other films he looks younger and younger in retrospect. Both he and Winslet are capable of so much more but neither really work individually or as a couple. Zane hams it up as a ""baddie"" and actually seems to be having a good time of it unlike his co-stars. Bates, Fisher, Paxton, Warner, Amis, Hyde and others all fill round the edges with so-so performances.There is no questioning that this was a massive success and will stand up in lists for years to come. However the effects are already dating and, them to one side, there isn't a huge amount else to spend three hours on. The love story is clunky to match the dialogue and the actors can do little with it producing an unconvincing love story that is forced out with manipulative and exploitative methods that are exposed as such with a clear eyed viewing. A big film but not really a good one.",No Rating
Holds up amazingly!,sunchick116-872-583383,8 December 2015,"There isn't much to say about this film other than incredible. A true epic masterpiece. I admit to seeing it five time in the theater an countless times since then. Once you've seen the film the first time, it's opening scene and music immediately drives you to tears and they don't really stop for the next 3 hours and 14 minutes. As clich√©d as the story of jack and Rose may be, a name had to be given to the faces that we lost in this preventable tragedy. And what a powerful love story it is. To have loved so deeply and passionately in such short a time and have it stay with you forever is what everyone wishes for themselves. A lot of flack is given to Cameron's script, and while it could be have been better, it certainly wasn't laughable. Winslet and DiCaprio gave incredible performances with what they were given and this film will truly stand the test of time, due to its powerful gritty nature. It was almost better back in the day when it was split up into two tapes and I would never put the 2nd one in because it was too heartbreaking to sit through. This film is truly a masterpiece. I've seen it a dozen time and ugly cry every time.",10/10
Cameron Delivers..!,canuckteach,2 March 2008,"For weeks after seeing the film, whenever I heard on the radio the flute introduction to ""My Heart Will Go On"" (Celine Dion), I became teary-eyed! So, I guess I am a sentimentalist! I think James Cameron delivered a unique, technically-brilliant period piece that could touch the heart, and inform audiences about some significant features of a long-forgotten era.For one, this time period was marked by severe class distinction. I believe that, in 1900, 1% of the USA population controlled 99% of the wealth. Britain, of course, had always been a society where the privileged were noted by everything from their manner of dress, hat style, speech patterns, and clubs where they drank. The film shows the severe gap between the wealthy first-class passengers, and those in 'steerage' where Jack was lodged. Some have argued that poor Jack would never have gotten near Rose a second time. But remember: Rose is a rebel. There's the basis for the relationship. And what better way to illustrate the snobbery of class distinction than by having Jack sit down to dinner with the crusty industrialists? Also, many on the Titanic were on their way to the 'new world' for great opportunities. They had a great struggle (note the passengers who could neither read nor write English?), but they came anyway to escape the oppression of cruel power struggles in Europe.The sheer folly - and tragedy - of piling through iceberg-infested waters in a large, awkward vessel is explained and demonstrated very clearly (in case anyone is still trying to figure it out!).This film is on my IMDb Top-20 .. http://www.imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=8401903 (yikes-I realized I better get busy and finally write a review!), but I will admit that some shortfalls in screenplay prevent it from usurping 'Citizen Kane', 'Amadeus' or Sir David Lean's entries as a true cinematic masterpiece. Note that I said screenplay - not acting, for actors can only deliver the lines on the page. I have always loved PART-1 much more than PART-2. I think that has to do with the 'mix' and 'editing', particularly involving the final scene with Jack and Rose. A few snips here and there would have reduced the melodramatic element. Overall, a little less of the love story, and more development of some other characters would have elevated the presentation. My take is that the screenplay 'missed' - but not by much. The result was a brilliant piece of cinematography that could not field any major players as viable candidates for Oscars in acting.Having said that, there is so much to recommend this fine film. I was very moved by the way Cameron had his Titanic cast assemble for a sort of curtain-call within the movie - haven't seen that before, very unique and effective.9/10 - canuckteach (--:",9/10
A metaphor for Planet Earth,dimplet,14 June 2009,"""Titanic"" is a prescient portent of things to come, a metaphor of human conceit.We are all passengers on the Titanic, oblivious to our fate, our planet a wreck, most of us doomed to die on the iceberg of climate change. Exactly when and where disaster will strike, no one knows for sure. But somewhere an iceberg is lurking in the dark with our name on it.The most cruel part of our fate is we have a James Cameron-class writer and director running the show. The story is bogged down and going nowhere. People are losing interest fast and falling asleep as the movie rolls.The ship we call HMS Planet Earth is doomed, but no one seems to care, just like the audience in Titanic.

A cinematic masterpiece and touching love story at its finest,loveislife1,11 November 2023,"Titanic is the backdrop of this timeless film about love.

He leads her and he shares his life with her. He takes her places and he affectionately cares for her. He declares his feelings for her and they share romantic moments together. Love is at the core of this film. It is a universal truth that touches our hearts and transcends boundaries. This film reveals love is what we are all looking for. Love is what we are here to experience in our lives as we live day-by-day.After all is said and done on your time on Earth, as you look back, what will you remember and cherish the most? What will be those memories?This film reminds us of what matters most in our lives. It is not material goods and comfort. But love. It is love that binds us to one another. Love is the source from which we come from.Life is a gift. It is up to each one of us to make the most of each day in our lives. The film conveys the message, live as though there is no tomorrow. For what is life without having lived it and experienced it to the fullest? In the end, what matters most is love. The love that sustains us, that gives us life. That makes us feel alive, cherished and safe.As I watched this film, my heart was deeply moved. Tears welled down my eyes. I felt what the characters were experiencing.

Spectacular recreation of famous historical event (major spoilers),alainenglish,20 August 2004,"The tale of the doomed ocean liner Titanic remains continually ripe for cinematic exploration.  Films, series and documentaries continue to abound on this most famous tragedy.  Encompassed within the simple tale of the demise of an 'unsinkable ship' is a story of intense tragedy (over 1,500 lives were lost), social divide (the rich/poor gap was highlighted here when the first class passengers were the first on the lifeboats, leaving many in steerage to die) and most of all, of man's arrogance and opportunism overwhelmed by the forces of nature.If anyone could bring this tale into 21st century (when it was only 1997!) it had to be James Cameron.  Cameron had the technical experience and flair necessary to build and sink the Titanic onscreen.  Sex and violence are par for the course in almost every action movie but, like his special effects, Cameron inventively works these elements to make them serve his story.So it is with ""Titanic"", where he uses a pair of doomed, starstruck lovers as a focal point for the audience to empathise and relate to the passengers on the ship.  The film begins in the present day where a diamond-hunting mercenary Brock Lovett (Cameron regular Bill Paxton) stumbles on a picture of a nude young woman wearing the diamond he is trying to locate.  Lovett is shocked when a very old lady (Gloria Stuart) identifies herself as the woman in the picture.  She comes aboard his vessel and relates to him and his team her experiences on Titanic.Cut back to 1912 and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) boards the ocean liner Titanic a sullen rich young woman.  She's being pushed by her mother (Frances Fisher) into a loveless marriage with Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), a vain self-centred tycoon.  The deadening misery of her life leads her to attempt suicide, but encounters Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a penniless artist who won his ticket in a poker game.  He saves her life, and they fall in love. But despite all their efforts, the affair cannot last,  especially when the ship strikes an iceberg and with not enough lifeboats, it's a race for survival...Cameron is especially keen on highlighting the class divide between rich and poor on Titanic.  The rich are shown as staid, self-centred and repressed, caring only about their money and their social status.  By contrast, the poor are shown as lively, honest, down-to-earth and fun.  The depiction is crudely stereotypical, but it works in favour of the story.  When they're locked below decks during the ship's sinking, you empathize with them and want them to get out.  Once the iceberg is sighted, no shot is wasted in cranking up the tension. Every aspect of the ship's sinking is seen, from the initial iceberg impact to the flooding corridors, the on-deck chaos as passengers struggle to board the lifeboats, to the grand final sinking.  Cameron further shows the aftermath of the sinking, with hundreds of survivors screaming and thrashing in the water as they slowly freeze to death.  All this works through superlative cinematography, special effects, editing, all underlined by James Horner's worthy music score.  The human element is not lost amid the action.  Leonardo DiCaprio is not rough-and-ready enough to really convince as a seen-it-all poor boy, but makes a good go of it, and is well partnered with Kate Winslet, who makes for a buxom, comely Rose.  Billy Zane (as Cal) and David Warner (as his manservant) make for slick, hateable villains and Frances Fisher brings Rose's mother a step up from simple caricature.The fictional characters blend in well with the real passengers, all of whom don't possess much depth but are still very well acted.  Standouts include Jonathan Hyde as the opportunistic Ismay, Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and Victor Garber as the ship's sympathetic architect.When the film returns to the present, you really do feel as though you were on Titanic, and it's hard to suppress a tear at the misty, dreamlike finale.Epic, and unforgettable.",No Rating

"""A Night to Remember 3""",curtis-8,21 August 1999,"I liked ""Titanic"". Its a good old fashioned adventure/romance/epic with a strong storyline and definable characters. Sure the tacked on romance is as stock as the characters, but that is still better than the alternative served up by most modern movies: ie--no plot and no characterization at all. The thing that bothers me about this version of the Titanic sinking is that writer/director Cameron takes full credit for the screenplay, when so much of it was directly lifted from a 1958 film about the event, ""A Night to Remember"" (also a book, and a previous film). And I'm not talking about the fact the Titanic sunk, or any of the other factual details of the story--obviously those will be the same. I'm talking about virtually identical scenes, events, and dialogue that could not be gathered from public record. Scenes such as the ship's builder standing alone in the tilted ballroom, looking at the painting on the wall as the ship goes down. Or the rich ship corporation a**hole being told that yes, his ship is going to sink, no matter what he says. Or identical scenes of the steerage rabble breaking through the gates. These scenes, and many others, are mounted and shot in so similar a fashion to the previous film, with such similar dialog, that I believe they cross the border into plagerism. Rent the 1958 version of ""A Night to Remember"", watch it, and tell me I'm wrong.",No Rating

The romance between Jack(DiCaprio) and Rose(Winslet) is fictional, but make the movie be even more dramatic,since we have a chance of be closer of some people in the story. The way the movie begins, showing some people making the search of Titanic and even some shots of the ship forgot in the sea is very interesting and in the last scene, when the old Rose dies, it's a beautiful and symbolic scene to see her meeting again Jack and all the people that were killed in Titanic's disaster again.Ps:This is one of the movies that I saw Kate Winslet, and I found her astonishing!",9/10

Downright amazingly bad,gatsby06,22 June 2007,"(THIS *&%$#! COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.)(Or it may not.At least it may spoil your appetite for this film.)I have to give James Cameron credit for a sort of devious ingenuity: He created a movie so repulsively bad that a reasonably sophisticated viewer would find it unbearable to sit through. Hence, so many glowing reviews.I watched it, once. But it keeps popping up on TV. And even for free it is not worth watching. Five minutes these days is my absolute limit. Each time I stumble across it, this movie just seems to get worse and worse. The acting is so bad I'm surprised Cameron didn't just make this into a sort of Disney cartoon. Disney's Buena Vista does this sort of simplistic bubble gum movie better, such as White Fang; Ethan Hawke as Jack Conroy was more credible than DiCaprio as Dawson. And the aerial computer graphics look way too much like cartoon animation.As to historical accuracy, give me a break!!! I can't say this is any worse than the other nonsense to come out of Hollywood, though. Frankly, anyone who takes any so-called non-fiction or historical movies as more than 1 percent accurate is a fool.Hey, I am willing to suspend a certain amount of disbelief for a good movie, but this one demands way too much. They pull a drawing that has been sitting on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean for 80 years that is in excellent condition and hold it up as proof of why it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars to find the Titanic. And what is this precious work of art? A Rembrandt? A DaVinci? A Van Gogh, at least? No, it is an amateurish pornographic sketch. Excuse me? Maybe some 21st century girl would pose naked at the drop of a hat, but a proper girl in the 1910s?Hey, if you believe this nonsense, then the rest of the movie will seem comparatively plausible, and I can see how you might find this movie ""historically accurate."" I don't mind if you enjoyed this movie; that's what movies are for. Tastes vary. Some people prefer emotional manipulation that is more subtle. I would hope you Titanic fans would explore cinema a little more, and not insist that this is the greatest movie ever made, perfect, etc. What's with all these superlatives? Does Cameron have a claque?Look, before you say Titanic is the best movie EVER, (which implies you have seen every movie every made) at least go see Gone With the Wind. I dare you. Then see if you can even mention Titanic in the same breath.And I think potential viewers should be forewarned that not everybody is going to like this movie. That's what reviews are for. Spoiler ahead: OK, the ship was named ""Titanic"" and it sank. That much they got right. Well, sort of: it was the RMS Titanic, not the SS Titanic.If you want to learn the true story, try going to the BBC page ""Titanic: Sinking the Myths,"" by Paul Louden-Brown.",3/10

"powerful scenery, emotional music, amazing costumes, and breathtaking cinematography",novagirl11,13 February 2022,"Decided to re-watch this because it's Valentine's weekend and because I thought there were probably parts I didn't remember. It's definitely the kind of movie that you catch more/different things every time you watch it. Of course, it's hard not to notice the powerful scenery, emotional music, amazing costumes, and breathtaking cinematography.",8/10
The Third Part!,Raja79,22 March 2022,"The third part was absolutely epic!The first two halves of this movie are very slow and mainly focus o building up the dialogues and the 20th century atmosphere or vibe, but then it is in the 3rd part that the ship actually starts to hit iceberg and start sinking.Everything that we have known for the first two parts gets destroyed in third part, which creates emotional conflict.",10/10
"Titanic, Greatest Love Story told, by a Genius Filmmaker!!",YasubMannanJiruwala,25 December 2022,"I was 14 years old when I first saw this movie back in 97 when it released. Recapping my days and watched it again today. When Rose let go of jack in the final scenes, I didn't just cry, I sobbed and I said to myself this is what true love looks and feels like.Cameroon made a movie for the generations. Not only the grandeur and the opulence but the heart, the soul of this movie, incredibly powerful and true. Touched me deep and hard even after all these years.Titanic is not just a movie, it's a movie that touches your heart and teaches you lessons of love, honour, respect, kindness and humanity for a lifetime.Highly recommended, do watch!!",10/10
Amazing love story,viggosokolich,6 March 2023,"I almost cried at the end of the movie it was so sweet. I'm might seem PG-13 but today it will probably be R a littel inappropriate.

If you read my message watch it is should be like 8.9 this is so good. The best film every. I ever seen.

The most beautiful fairy tale,edobryakova,8 March 2023,"The legendary film of all time is ¬´Titanic¬ª. This film is directed by James Cameron. It's based on the true story of the biggest ship Titanic, who crashed in 1912. It had the most Oscar nominations 11 times. Stars such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet starred in the film.It was filmed in Mexica where a full-size model of the ship was made for filming. A pool with a displacement of 4 million liters was also created there. When creating the Titanic, computer graphics and special effects were actively used
This film tells the story of the first and, unfortunately, the last voyage of the largest ship at that time. As well as the love story of two young people who met each other on this ship. The story of a young rich girl, Rosa, who sailed in first class, and a poor artist who won a ticket to a ship in cards.I recommend this film for viewing, because it is very beautifully filmed, beautiful interiors and costumes. A beautiful love story, this is a legendary film that everyone should watch. The whole world knows about him and he personifies all the romantic films of the world. It is about true love, about tears, about friendship, mutual understanding and sacrifice. And of course, the famous Celine Dion soundtrack fits perfectly into the most popular shot from 'Titanic', where two lovers are free and happy on the deck.",10/10
A real life story with a fictional twist,buehnec,13 March 2019,"It all starts off with a 100 year old woman named Rose DeWitt Bukater telling her story full of love and loss. The story takes place on the luxurious, but ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic, with young Rose boarding the departed ship with the upper class passengers and her mother. Meanwhile, a traveler and an artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio win third class tickets to the ship in a game of poker. The story explains a seventeen-year-old noblewomen falling in love with a kind, but poor artist.It is a real life story, with a fictional twist. The movie shows two completely different worlds and how they connect, putting aside the labels and showing the purest of love. A great lesson for the real world. Jack and Rose spend their days together experiencing and learning new things from each other. The tale starts off with young Rose convincing herself to jump off of the ship due to her life situation of being forced to marry a self involved man that only loves money and himself. Jack spots young Rose leaning over the rail and tries to convince her saying ""I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here."" His attempt to help is successful and is invited to a meal as a result of his heroic act.The whole story with the movie is iconic. It has greatly impacted then and is still now. It has made a major impact in the movie industry, and is still evolving. It's a story being told while also being lived at the same time. Now the ship lies at the bottom of the ocean with its remains only able to last another 15 to 20 years, the film is here to keep the memory of the titanic alive. Great success and great things have come out of this movie for many different reasons.I recommend this movie for anyone from teens/young adults to elders. The historic event tying to a beautiful, but fictional story. It's been over 105 years and people are still fascinated with it. So if you are looking to watch a love story that never fails to make you cry, or maybe also a movie with a historic purpose, then I highly recommend watching the Titanic.",10/10
Sure I cried ...,Motorskallen,14 July 2005,"But NOT because the movie is an oh, so tragic story about two young lovers and a boat sinking in the sea. But because of one person - ONE PERSON ONLY - spent about a billion dollars on this movie (while about a billion human beings can't get food for the day, a house to sleep in or clean clothes) and didn't succeed to make a great movie. Three hours is how long this was. That's at least about two and a half hour too much. One thing if it they spent the money on a documentary on the subject, or at least spent the money on better boats, but not on this awful movie. The silly plot, ridiculous jokes, bad actors, an unoriginal subject ... What more can I say? O yeah - it has great special effects! ""But that's at least something!"" you might say! NO - IT'S - NOT! It's just another problem. Because special effects are not all, and if they had to spend money on special effects, they could at least have made a greater movie. I hope the producers and the director will spend the rest of eternity in hell, watching this movie. Over and over again.",1/10
Beautiful film let down by a god-awful plot,gsceldridge,6 October 2012,"I have given this film 1 because, for its time, the special-effects were truly excellent, and also because the costumes were and still are breath-takingly beautiful. I watched this film back-to-back as a teenager out of adoration for Leo, and now I am an adult I went to watch it again in 3D, expecting to be wowed like before. Oh dear. Themes of the film - ""Rich people are evil, all of them. Only poor people have feelings."" ""Cheating on your fianc√© is fine, and he is not allowed to have any kind of reaction to this."" ""If we don't both fit on this wardrobe door, one of us will surely die...but let's only half-heartedly try once to fit us both...""Also, Kate Winslet is supposed to be 18!? REALLY!?!?!?!

Wow ok well the unexpected happened...,nscoby93,25 February 2023,"For years now I have been wanting to go back and watch Titanic to give it a real shot as considering this film released in '97 I was a child and when I did see it I was far to young to appreciate it.So upon hearing James Cameron had plans to release a 4k 3D restoration of Titanic in theaters I knew this was my chance.All my adult life I've made fun of Titanic and ironically liked the films central song ""My Heart Will Go On"" but damn it I must be honest. I genuinely enjoyed this film, I thought it was really good. I still can't believe it, two hours since I walked out of the theater all I can think is ""I liked Titanic"" with a puzzled face.While I don't believe it's the masterpiece that a lot would say it is, it is one Cameron's best work.Great cinematography, great acting, good writing, good storytelling, and a beautiful score. The music was fantastic in this film and now I actually like that song, which is now undoubtedly going to be stuck in my head for the remainder of the day.There were some moments in dialogue and certain lines that made roll my eyes or think people don't talk that way. Sometimes corny but the love story is a lot better than most. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are fantastic and both had great chemistry, really making me believe in this romance of theirs.The supporting cast is just as strong here if not at times stronger. While the love story was good and had its place what drew me into the film more were the characters who talked of the Titanic it's construction and how they boosted of it tremendously. To know it's outcome and to see how they could've avoided this tragedy if they were just more humble and made smarter decisions was astounding to me.The film was beautiful and it's restoration fantastically done that if I didn't know better it looked like it could've been made today. The 3D though I must say didn't add anything it had some moments in the beginning but when I would take my 3D glasses to rest my eyes I could see the movie just as well.Still I am surprised that I enjoyed this film as much I did, when and if Cameron releases this in 4k Blu-ray I will definitely be picking it up.IMDb: 8/10

Accurate to history and very moving,trangell-02621,15 December 2019,"This is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has so many little details that relate to the actual history about it. Even some of the things people say relates right to what actually happened. It does have some minor flaws like how the ship is built, but other than that, I thought it was fairly accurate.Also, the director really connects you with the characters. With Rose, you feel bad for her that she is forced to marry this terrible man and with Jack, you feel bad for him because he keeps getting stereotyped into a ""poor man."" You can tell that they have such a connection right away as well. Towards the beginning, when Rose is on the railing of the ship, Jack comes in and saves her, which brings them closer together. They have an unbreakable bond. At some points in the film, I did get a little teary-eyed from how Rose was treated by her fianc√© and mother. It was so unfair that she could never make her own decisions. The same goes with Jack too, when Rose's fianc√© and mother would discriminate him because he didn't have nearly as much in his pocket. These examples help you grow fond of the characters and help you feel what they feel.This film is fairly historically accurate and a timeless classic.",9/10
One of the best films ever made.,Keemshave,27 June 2019,"How could I not give this film a 10/10. Sure, there is some corny dialogue and some romance that gets a bit too sentimental for my taste, but that doesn't hold this film back from greatness. It's the best romance film ever made and will have you tearing up no doubt. Once the iceberg is hit, the film goes to another level. The already well established characters are thrown into this tragedy that had me glued to the screen. Cameron's production is far ahead of it's time and deserves all the praise that it gets. The ending is also something that really makes me think about life and death, as a philosophical thinker. Having a dreamlike state after death and seeing what you truly care about...meeting up with the ones you love...is heaven. It's such a beautiful ending and gives me chills everytime.",10/10
2nd most grossing film ever,tommoboi,18 July 2015,"What a wonderful film. James Cameron done a brilliant job bring this historical event to life. Everything was perfect, the timing of the film, the effects , the cast can't fault Cameron. You couldn't of asked for any better actors/ actress to fill the main two roles Leo and Kate have some much chemistry on film and you can feel the love and heartbreak between them outstanding acting. The fact this film is based on true even gives you that extra edge that you wanna see the film makes you feel the pain that actually happened. The number of awards says it all for this film. One of only two films along with Avatar to gross over 2billion incredible. If anyone has not watched this film they are missing out it is purely just a cult film. People off all ages love this film, male or female too. The thrills, love, heartbreak, excitement will draw you in to the most amazing love and historical film to ever hit the big screen.

Don't waste your time unless you're on a date.,danielaustin-735-484497,21 November 2016,"Went to watch this on a date because, my then GF wanted to see it like most of the female population. It rumbles along at a steady pace with not much happening apart from some good effects and a boring love story. The story between the two lead actors feels awkward and false. It is a bit of a bore to be blunt but the special effects save it. Typical Hollywood romantic dross. This is not a film for men! Be safe - stay away!!5/10",5/10
More garbage... what a surprise!,srobi280,21 April 2006,"Let me start off by saying that there really can't be any spoilers about this movie, as anyone who knows anything about history already knows how this film will end. The Titanic is going to sink! What a surprise! There are three major reasons why I don't like this movie.Reason 1: We know how the film is going to end before we even see it. The ship is going to sink. If filmmakers want to make a movie in which the audience already knows what is going to happen, they need to do a better job than to simply turn it into a sappy love story. Which brings me to the second reason.Reason 2: This is another historical event turned into a sappy love story, blended in which a whole lot of Hollywood inaccuracy. The acting is terrible, and the characters are very uninteresting.Reason 3: Time. This movie is more than three hours long! Is that really necessary? No it isn't. It is a three hours of my life that I could have used way more productively. It is a three hours of my life, gone forever! Wasted! And I can never get it back! I was thankful when DiCaprio died, because I knew the movie was almost over. I can't believe this movie got so much praise. Its right there in the same league as ""Pearl Harbor"". Pure, un-adulterated junk. I gave it a 3/10, only because they did a pretty nice job ""reviving"" the ship itself. Don't watch it. If you take my advice, you have just saved three hours of your life.",3/10
Greatest movie in generations,jebyvyson,4 May 2019,"I know this is the best (overrated) movie of all, so I watched this film...it earn its place as the best movie of all time. The visual surprising still holds up for a movie that came out 2 decades ago, the music score is the best thing I ever heard, the cinematography is beautifully shot, and the tone of the movie is very lovable and emotional. Watching this for first time is such a blast, but sadly, I won't have that same feeling again if I go watch it again. This movie is very memorable for generations to come.",10/10
The definition of perfection,baunacholi-86159,1 January 2020,"There has been nothing similar before and it's hard to imagine something like titanic will ever be created that masterfully & epic again.
I will not respond to any low ratings and leave these viewers alone with their well, opinion. To me TITANIC is the definition of perfection. It came to the absolutely right time. Maybe a few years earlier or later the impact to society would have been less big or even bigger? anyway it influenced a whole generation and even a decade later it has not lost a single spark. It's still the one and only benchmark for any movie. Titanic inspires young and old, brings everyone with a heart to tears and impresses with the highest level of detail in movie making. I'm so thankful I was part of the premiere and the re-screening.
Titanic delivers the perfect 10 on all levels. The attention to detail, eg the dishes and furniture have been all recreated 1:1 to the original. The cast, Katy Bates & esp Kate Winslet (who, in my opinion was shockingly robbed to win her 1st academy award. Alone for heart breaking deleted scene where she had a mental breakdown was one of the best performances by any actress !) and then of course the score: haunting & epic. Recognizable under millions of other melodies including the modern classic my heart will go on.
And when this beautiful ship hits the iceberg and the desaster evolves into the inevitable I know I will weep at exactly the same scenes ... and I'll never let go.",10/10
Bad and Good - no other film like it,dockbennett,7 April 2012,"I first saw ""Titanic"" in fairly early 1998, I think, here in Australia. I went with a girl I had recently got to know on the Internet. She had already seen it, and spoke in raptures about it after we left the cinema, while I was hesitating somewhat, as I was not sure about what I had just witnessed. Since then, I have seen the film at least twice more, including just now, and I stick by my opinion that I have never seen a movie that is so bad and so good at the same time. The bad, as so many people have said, is the script. Well, the characters too. The main romance is so embarrassingly contrived as to be juvenile, and this is not helped by the character of Rose. Quite frankly, I can't stand her, and can only wonder why Jack did not push the little brat off the ship when he had the chance. Speaking of Jack, I liked him. He and Molly Brown were, by far, the two best characters shown. I'm not bagging the acting of Winslett. I think she did well. I just thought her character was loathsome. Not much better is Cal. I couldn't stand him either, and yes, I know you're not meant to like him, but I didn't like the way I didn't like him! Talk about a corny villain. Snobby, cowardly... by the time he picked up the child to get his way off the ship, I was thinking, ""Alright, we get the idea. He's a creep."" Really, I thought the whole ""first class and the rest"" concept was overdone. Yes, I know it was an issue, but it's so clumsy and obvious as to be cringe worthy. But probably the worst and most disappointing character was the captain. Here was someone I would have loved to got to know. Ultimately, the sinking was all his fault. Yet there was no depth to him, instead just coming off as a feeble human being who did and said little, and who looked (understandably) more and more desolate as he saw what was happening. But then there is the good. The sinking. Absolutely incredible. I am always fascinated by the fact that the ship started to sink but, as is the nature of such events, everything looks normal for a while. People moved around as usual, the ship just kept motoring along. And yet we knew it would be under water in a couple of hours. The gradual submersion is enthralling, and technically brilliant. This is why I like to come back to the film, and no it's not because I'm a disaster fan (which I am) who just wants to see people die and not care about things like romance. Not at all. Really, no. A key to such films is depth of character and their relationships with each other. No real people means no emotional charge when said disaster happens. The effects are breathtaking, and the model work stunning. I can't enthuse enough about this part of the film.But the bad comes close to killing it all, and my view does not change after each time I see it. ""Titanic"" polarises me like no other film I've ever seen. It is awful. It is tremendous. Ultimately, the mixture makes it a middling film at best, which is a great shame. How it won Best Picture at the Oscars remains one of the biggest jokes in cinema history. But maybe, if we can forget about the bad, we can revel in the good, and appreciate some of the most stunning moments ever filmed in Hollywood.",6/10
A cinematic epic,aadisrivasta,5 May 2023,"Titanic is a film brought by crafted film-maker James Cameron and stars gifted actor Leonardo DiCaprio and talented actress Kate Winslet. It's a true masterpiece that stays true to the real tragedy in 1912 even if it involves some fictional elements. While a jack and Rose relationship didn't happen on the real titanic(and would have certainly not happen due to strict class segregation), their relationship is still beautiful and extremely emotional. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are both phenomenal in their performances as Jack and Rose respectively and there couldn't have been any other actor and actress who could have played those characters better than Leo and Kate did. Even Gloria Stuart portrays Old Rose very well.Billy Zane also plays a great villain as Cal Hockley. As the son of a steel tycoon millionaire, he goes from a gentlemen to a madman when he discovers rose's love for jack and a desperate person who wants to save his own skin and not caring for others the moment he realises the situation is getting serious.The visual effects are stunning. James Cameron has managed to bring the Iconic Ocean liner the titanic back to life in screen and make it look so real. The effects are futuristic even by 1997 standards. The song My heart will go on by Celine Dion really fits the movie very well. The direction by James is also beautifully crafted and the cinematography is also well done.The emotional depth is felt as well through jack succumbing to the effects of hypertomia but saving rose in the process to the deaths of over 1500 people in the ship. The rest of the cast do perform their roles well.While there are a few historical inaccuracies in the film, the movie is still beautifully made.",10/10

It's a crying freaking shame,ehrmantraut,31 August 2005,"It's a crying freaking shame that this outstanding movie's rating has been dragged down by small people who hate it because it was successful. You should be ashamed of yourselves. When I first saw it I thought it was the perfect movie, and it's still one of my favorites 8 years later. It's got sexual tension, action, social commentary, and the acting doesn't suck. It's even got Bill Paxton, one of my top 10 criteria for a great movie. What's so horrible about it that it deserves an aggregate 6.9? The only reason I can think of is this perverse habit people have of hating anything that makes so much money or is otherwise successful that it makes them doubt their own worth. That's just sad, and you shouldn't take it out on an innocent blockbuster.",10/10
Greatest chick movie ever made!,askeland89,29 October 2023,"While I may be generalizing, I have a valid reason to do so.. This movie is for girls and don't even try to deny it. The love story between Leo and Kate is it's biggest selling point, it's what it will be remembered for and stuff like this generally don't appeal to boys.. Personally I love this movie but not necessarily for the love story. It's extremely well made and it looks good even 26 years later.. And I'm biased towards James Cameron. Most girls movies are low to mid budget and with more cheese than I can handle... This is the only movie of the category I find tolerable. It is hands down, the best girls movie ever made. Nothing comes close to it. Far from flawless, lots of production errors and such but it doesn't matter. Titanic is a classic no matter how you look at it.",8/10
Most Overrated Film in History,GeneralB,30 September 1999,"I have grown quite sick of this movie and the Celiene Deon song.  If there wasn't some much said about it, I probably would have liked it more. Frankly, the dialogue and much of the plot was silly.  The way they told the story, by starting in the present, was quite interesting, and compared to other disaster films its outstanding, but best movie of all time? NO!",1/10
"Upon Catastrophe, Sprouts Humanity",dorMancyx,13 February 2023,"Even today, the romance depicted in Titanic is neither cliche nor cringeworthy in my opinion. Jack's unbridledness, discernment, fondness and Rose's rebelliousness, tenacity, faithfulness are all performed naturally by the two then-inexperienced, juvenile actors, contrasting intriguingly to their future stardoms. From their first encounter to the third class party, and from the sketching room to the purple car, the duo's dalliance is so full of relatable temptation, contradiction, and rapport between two youthful souls. However, this perfect love story is spoiled due to the 90 minute final act, when all there's left is ""Jack!"" and ""Rose!"" and ""I won't let go"" and intense respiration --- blame Cameron for excessively elongating the ending, fatiguing both the performers and the audience.Watching beyond the romantic aspect, this theatrical spectacle comprises all of scientific excavation, historical documentation, class distinction, generational soundtrack, visual effect breakthrough, thriller-action sequences, humanity in crisis, and the lamentation of a gone era. For one, the way James Cameron presented the Titanic's grandeur is undoubtedly groundbreaking, positioning the nautical giant in wide panel shots or out of frame to illustrate is gargantuan size, while adding seagulls and sailboats for juxtaposition. The hour-long disaster would have also been sensational if not for Jack and Rose repeatedly getting out and going back into the hull for a sundry absurd reasons. And lastly, it's been scientifically proven that the door fits two afloat god damn it!In all, a film that was, is, and likely will continue to be unceasing, as are the golden tales a century before.",8/10

"big, expensive and banal",wiseman-4,18 June 2004,"I saw 'Titanic' twice as it was released in 1997. My first impression was ""wow"", it felt really stunning and visually impressive, big and simply the ""best"". However the impression was lost soon. One thing I realized - 'good movie' is not equal to 'expensive movie'. After this I saw hundreds of films and I started to evaluate them from a different point of view and 'Titanic' sank to the ocean of Hollywood production, not leaving a footstep after it.This was a very expensive film, but as I now remember the whole story, the way it was shown, the grandiose hype of it... it feels completely banal, plain and... cheap. Cheap not in terms of money spent on it but in terms of plot, acting and general style of the movie. Yes I have to pay my respect to the director for such a grandiose work and all those Oscars he received (even though they're not that valuable anywhere but in Hollywood), but to my opinion this film is an expensive and unsuccessful attempt to make a good film. Yes, the views were nice and realistic, but that's all. There's nothing more I could rate positively in this film except the technical special effects. How many more criterion's despite special effects are there while rating a movie?I congratulate the makers of 'Titanic', they did a good business and after spending $ hundreds of millions they profited even more but that doesn't make 'Titanic' a good film. It's just another 'stunning' piece of Hollyywood production in the bad meaning of it. Sorry if I sound too harsh but I really mean it. For nice effects - 4/10",1/10
"This, in itself, is a reason never to trust the Oscars.",Giac-3,16 October 1999,"It is appalling that James Cameron hitched his disaster movie to the late-1990s fascination with the R.M.S. Titanic.  He can now lump himself with other filmmakers such as Oliver Stone who distort history in an effort to make a film about something other than the historical event they end up teaching the American public about.  But, even setting aside my disdain for his gross inaccuracies in Titanic history, and going with my deepest feelings that films are for enjoyment and escapism, this movie lacked the most important part of any film developing characters: I didn't care about Rose or Jack.  Rose was spoiled.  Jack was a foolish brat.  This film also contained the fatal flaw in triangle love stories: I liked the bad guy. Billy Zane, beauty aside, was still the only character who probably was on the Titanic, and the only one I hoped made it off the ship alive.  It is better to see the film that should have won the Oscar that year (LA CONFIDENTIAL) rather than waste anymore time even reading more comments about the movie that did win the Oscar.",1/10
Melodrammatic Soap Opera with Special Effects,AttyTude0,23 May 2022,"Saturday night, hubby wanted to watch this thing again and since it was too late to go shopping, or something, I agreed. I didn't like it the first time and I didn't like it the second time. Unlike wine, it didn't improve with age. Glad to see I am not the only one who was not taken in by Cameron's melodrammatic soap opera. At the time, everybody was going into raptures over this film. Me, I found only one redeemable feature: the soundtrack. Maybe because I never liked any of the actors - don't like Leo, hate Zane, can't stand Kate - but I could not wait for this sentimental mess to end.The story right up there with those old plays that were performed on river boats in 19th century South. The rich guy is the villain. Check. The peniless loser is the good guy. Check. The society girl falls for the peniless loser. Check. They left nothing out. No, I tell a lie. They left out a good, interesting plot.In my humble opinion, this film tanked as deeply as the Titanic.BTW, I saw on YouTube that the song, My Heart Will Go On was blocked in some countries.

"Titanic, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways.",jorel1114,23 May 2000,"Why does this movie suck so bad?  More importantly, why did it win an oscar for among other things, best picture?  There are so many holes in the film's plot, the villian is similar to one in a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon (I was wondering why they didn't give him a mustache which he could rub between his fingers), the long sweeping shots of the ship look horrible, the script is lame and filled with cliched action movie lines and all of the scenes taking place in the present day are worthless and have no place.First, if Rose is telling this story from her perspective how is it that she knows what her fiance is always planning?  How does she know what the crew of the ship is talking about before and after the iceberg hit?  How is it that she knows how exactly Jack got on the ship or what he talked about with his friends onboard?  You get the idea?  Now many movies have this problem, but not a best picture winner. Second, the villian who's name escapes me.  He was so cliched.  So evil it was funny.  He's like Travolta in his new horrible film.Third, the fly over shots of the ship look like garbage.  They are so obviously fake, all the people appear as black, lifeless silohoettes walking the ship. Fourth, the script.  How did these horrible lines that Jack utters get in there?  When danger is afoot, no matter how great all he can utter is his best Keanu Reeves impersonation. Fifth, what is the purpose of showing us the salvage crew?  Who gives what these idiots are thinking or doing.  It further complicates things. Why would these people believe an elder Rose just because she says she is the one in the picture.  Anyone could call up and say that.  If they cut these parts of you have a much shorter film.I HATE THIS MOVIE.L.A. CONFIDENTIAL WILL ALWAYS BE 1997 TRUE BEST PICTURE",No Rating
"Make another Terminator, Jim.",Giac-3,8 December 1998,"I will never understand the common man, and therefore will never understand the mass hysteria over this movie.  I did not care about any of the passengers James Cameron took the time to introduce us to.  In fact, we know none of the true heart-breaking tales of the R.M.S. Titanic - only the fanciful romantic tale of a spoiled brat and the only American in steerage. It is frightening to me that America embraced this movie without ever learning one bit of true history about the disaster of the Titanic.  5 will get you 10 that most of America believes there was such a jewel as the Heart of the Ocean.  We already know many fools clamored around the graves of anyone known as Jack Dawson.  Most offensive, however, are Mr. Cameron's comments at the Oscars without any regard for the 1523 lives actually lost on the R.M.S. Titanic.

"Good subject, poor handling",Member,20 November 2003,"I saw this one in the movie theater and kept cringing through the whole film. This film is so full of moments and actors etc. which done a little differently would have made me like the film, perhaps. The film isn't 'Gigli'-bad, it is fairly typical of Camerons new found style of making three digit milj. - budget films. I liked the original Terminator, it worked even if it sometimes looks a bit dated. The Titanic looks outdated already, and it doesn't have much going for itself except the remnants of the marketing campaign. 1/10.",1/10

Beautiful romance movie,ryanward-45039,16 April 2022,"In 1912, the RMS Titanic is ready to set sail for New York across the Atlantic as we see Rose (Kate Winslet) who is engaged to a snobby chump named Cal (Billy Zane). As the ship sails off, Rose in many respects feels like a prisoner wanting to follow her own path. Due to her depression, she attempts to kill herself by jumping off the ship's stern. But luckily a person named Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) saves her and both fall in love. But then fate appears in the form of a iceberg as the ship hits the berg on the starboard side. While the ship is said to be unsinkable, she is unable to cobble the deadly forces of nature as she begins to sink.In my opinion this is James Cameron's best movie next to the two Terminator movies. The characters are very likable. Jack Dawson is my favorite character and he's a good-hearted person. It's also very funny when he swears. Rose is more of the main character in the movie. For one of her first roles, Kate Winslet really does a bang-up job in her performance. She could whip butt and I find her very loving. Billy Zane's character is much a abusive butthole and tried to kill the main characters. My favorite moment is the drawing scene and I learned that James Cameron actually drew the picture. Aside from the Titanic sinking, the most heartbreaking moment is when Jack dies and I cried my eyes out. The music here is made by the late James Horner and I absolutely loved it. Overall this is the greatest Hollywood movies and fun to watch.I'll give it a 9/10.",9/10
I seem to be the only who hated this poor excuse of a film,Agent10,11 April 2002,"Titanic opened on the day of birth, and my birthdays have progressively gotten worse since that day. To me, Titanic presents a myriad of raw anger and spite. I could bash this movie for years. and my insults would never cease. From the improbable story line, to the putrid acting performance by Leo has made this movie a bane of existence.One would say I'm nothing but a bitter person, but such insinuations could be further from the truth. If I had enough guts, I would burn every last print in existence. No one is going to remember this film except for the fact they spent 20 bucks to buy a crummy movie which has spurned equally dull films of the same formula (the Green Mile, Pearl Harbor, and many more to come).I just have one big question for all of the idiots who voted for the Academy Awards for the year 1997.

Eternal Love,w-71474,28 March 2020,"""Titanic"" gave me too much touch. Shocked by the thrilling scenes, he occasionally left a line on the soft sandy beach in his heart. But now, it was completely moved by it, and it was deeply imprinted into the memory. Even when the fireworks were set off on New Year's Eve, I saw the fireworks rising, blooming, and falling in the dark night sky. I remembered the distress signal sent by the captain when the Titanic was killed. The fireworks also rose to the vast starry sky, bloomed, and landed on the infinite sea. And the naive little girl on the boat smiled happily because she saw the beautiful fireworks. I still feel heartache when I think of it. People's feelings will always get deeper and deeper with age.

Why pay 9 bucks to see a three hour film you know the ending to?,Vegie,3 January 1999,"I must've been drunk. The acting is wooden, the character development almost non-existent and the music irritating(I HATE Celine Dion). The FX are great, but who cares?. Of the cast, Leo has one good moment at the end, but it drags on. Kate looks terrible in her costumes, but it's nice to see she's not a twig. Pity she can't act. Billy Zane has seldom shown restraint, and this film is no exception. Oscar winner Kathy Bates, however is solid as an iceberg...er...rock as the ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, but she can't save it. Jim Cameron has been responsible for many screen classics, but this isn't one of 'em. The dialogue is extremely funny. To give you an indication of how much I luuurrvved this film, the Federal election was on at the same time, and I decided to watch a bit of that!Would I have enjoyed it more on the big screen?Dialogue and characterisation is no different at the cinemas.

Delighted to find so many fellow Titanic-bashers,cathyyoung1,10 May 2000,"The only good thing about this movie are the special effects (truly incredible!), including the underwater scenes.  What else does it have? Let's see:One of the worst screenplays ever put on film.One-dimensional, dull, trite characters who are either improbably admirable (our lovely Rose can appreciate Picasso, knows all about Dr. Freud, and can figure out that there aren't enough lifeboats for all the passengers!) or ridiculously evil (Cal, the guy played by Billy Zane).  Not to mention tiresome cliches of the noble poor vs the ignoble rich.Leonardo di Caprio, basically modeling instead of acting.  Kate Winslet doing a more decent job, but nowhere near her performance in ""Sense and Sensibility"" where she was given a real character to play.The only emotion generated by this movie came from knowing that more than 1,200 people actually did die on the Titanic.  And even the disaster scenes weren't nearly as affecting as they should have been -- because the lives and deaths of thousands became merely a backdrop to the romance between Kate and Leo (sorry, Rose and Jack) and the question of whether they would survive.  (Personally, I found myself wishing they had both drowned early in the movie when Rose tried to jump and Jack was going to jump after her.)If you want to see a GOOD movie about the Titanic, rent ""A Night to Remember.""  It was made, I think, in 1948 and obviously had very poor special effects by today's standards, but it did an incomparably superior job of telling the story of the ship and its passengers.  (By the way, the only good bits of dialogue in ""Titanic"" -- the conversations between the crew when they realize the ship is going to sink -- are basically lifted from that film.)  Wisely, ""A Night to Remember"" doesn't focus on a couple of central characters and instead shows us many different people, who are much more fully fleshed out in the small vignettes they get than Jack and Rose were in all those unbearable hours of screen time.  In that way, ""A Night to Remember"" truly captures the human tragedy of what happened.The fact that ""Titanic"" won the Best Picture award in a year that saw such superb films as ""LA Confidential"" and (one of my all-time favorites) ""Boogie Nights"" just shows the cowardice of the Academy and the marketing power of 13-year-old girls.",5/10
I strongly recommend that you watch this movie.,kittiwaranoey,5 March 2021,"One of my favorite films is Titanic.This movie tells the dramatic story of the Titanic from the main actors are Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet.The movie starts from 1912 a young poor guy, travels by the gorgeous ship Titanic from London to New York with big dream. On the ship he meets a fabulous, wealthy girl.Then he fells in love with her as soon as he sees her.After a few day the ship hits an enormous iceberg and tragedy begins to unfold.The Titanic starts sinking.The movie shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending. The acting is first-rate. Leonardo Di Caprio's and kate Winslet's performance is so brilliant that l cried during the whole movie.Jack and Rose, they both have amazing personality and who watched this story no one wanted Jack to die but it was really good how it went with the story.There is also some comedy and romance.And this movie will brings a tear to your eyes. I have watched this movie for third time that make me cries every time. The love story goes deeper in meaning than any other.In some ways this movie is also a tribute to the power of memory and means so much.Because the story between both of them was not only a beautiful love story but it also captured the societal pressure of a young and wealthy woman in their time.So I absolutely love this movie in every single way possible.",8/10
"Has its flaws, but in my opinion was pretty good",Tommy-92,15 September 1999,"Yes, it was wildly over-rated, in that respect serving only to inflate Jim cameron's ego.  Yes, it is certainly not the best movie ever made.  Yes, the script was weak, and the acting isn't really too wonderful.  Leonardo DiCaprio has the blandest, most obvious lines I've ever heard, does not act them very well at all, and basically suvrives only on his smile and the fact that everyone knew millions of teenage girls would be swooning.  I didn't understand Billy Zane's character, but he wasn't on very much, so I didn't have to be confused by him a lot.  I do think it's awful that all those girls cried only over ""Leo"" and not over the thousands of people who died, but for those who were watching for another reason, there is still a pretty good movie there, in my opinion.  The scope is amazing, with all the sweeping shots, lavish, mostly accurate details, and spectacular effects. Cameron really orchestartes the mood of every scene wonderfully; though some of it is pretty cheesy, for the most part I really was caught up in it. While the acting isn't spectacular, as I said, some of the people turn in pretty good performances.  Kate Winslet did for the most part, though in the action scenes, where she's given the role of hero, instead of doing something with it she just pants away and screams for Leo and does nothing else.  Otherwise, she handles the acting pretty well.  Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, the captain, the designer of the ship, and the many third-class passengers were also good.  Even though the movie focused on fictional characters and not on these people, there's enough there to really affect you.  Seeing them being so cruelly and unjustly shut up in steerage and not being allowed to get to the lifeboats is a pretty powerful scene.  And just tell me you weren't in some way moved by the mother singing her kids to sleep, the old couple (who were real) hugging each other in bed, the people getting shot and killed by smokestacks, the captain shutting himself in as the windows break, and the band playing on and on and on.  I mean, come on! This really happened!  It was the most affecting part of the movie for me. I guess it was because I was so affected by it that I felt sad when Leo went under.  All the nay-sayers concentrate on the fiction part, which admittenly isn't up to the standards of these scenes, but also is not the only thing there.  Perhas if people just didn't look at the first part and only at the second part, they'd understand one reason why this movie was so successful. Yes, the teenage girls were a big factor, or so we hear, but plenty of other people went two and three times besides them, and they went because they were so affected by it that they just had to see it again.  Maybe it doesn't deserve to be the most successful movie ever made, but it deserves to be a classic, and undoubtedly will be no matter what anyone says.  Yes, it has flaws, but what movie doesn't?  There's more to this movie besides those flaws, if you just look.",7/10

Still an epic,neil-476,19 April 2012,"14 years ago I took my then 12 year-old daughter to see a three hour plus film, expecting her to get fidgety: she did not. Neither did I. And now, having seen the movie a number of additional times on a smaller screen, I revisit it on a big screen after a 3D revamp.My first viewing of this movie carried preconceptions with it: I was expecting it to retell the disaster, and I was expecting spectacular eye candy. I got both, and I appreciated that Cameron had chosen a fictitious love story as a vehicle for audience identification to bring home the tragedy on a personal level.On re-watching it 14 years later, I realise that what I'm watching is a romance, played out against the background of the Titanic disaster. I also realise a number of other things: for instance, the groundbreaking computerised extras are no longer as convincing as they were, James Horner's music is great, Cameron's direction is excellent and his writing, despite the occasional clunky bit of dialogue, is very skillful. Oh, and while the performances of the principals are very good, there is some very dodgy work from some of the bit part players.Overall, the verdict is that this film deserved its Oscars. And the 3D conversion has been very successfully carried out, and confirms that Cameron is one of a very small number of directors who truly understands 3D.",10/10

"Years from now, people will look back and wonder why.",JakeSpy,25 March 2000,"Why did James Cameron go to so much trouble making a film that presented the physical and visual dimensions of Titanic and take the human dimensions on a fantasy-romp of titanic-sized contrivances? There are enough historical documents and memoirs about REAL people on that ship who had REAL lives and some were actually very compelling.  So why did Cameron opt to give these REAL people bit parts and invent two shallow characters? 
Good acting and high production values go a long way to cover up a poor script, and Titanic is proof of that with the Oscar frenzy that surrounded it (However, it was the first film in a long time that did not earn a screenplay nomination and won best picture).  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet both did excellent jobs acting as did Gloria Stuart and Kathy Bates. They all deserved an Oscar in light of what they had to work with on the page.  How conventional, shallow and contrived does this sound?  Rose is in what is for all intents and purposes an arranged marriage, but she is really a free spirit ready to fly away from her upper-class roots.  If it wasn't for her darn mother.  Now to make this issue even more clear, her fiance is controlling and abusive.  The decision is clear.  She has to fall for Jack, a fellow free spirit who shows her real love.  Alas, Jack must be symbolically sacrificed so she can avoid being drowned in her life and truly find freedom in the new land.  Not only are the mechanics of the script clear, but the story is old and tired.  Titanic works because it plays on stereotypical conventions and latent emotions; it does not earn its emotional climax on its own merit.  This subject has the opportunity to be so much more genuine and powerful if only someone had taken the time to look beyond fictional romance and into true life tragedy.",No Rating
Strangely Universal,joncheskin,28 March 2020,"Watched this movie for a second time recently with my 17-year-old son. He actually suggested the viewing, he heard about the movie and was curious. Rarely have I had a better entertainment experience with a family member.Titanic is just simply awesome, a movie that you just sit back and marvel at. Photography, special effects, costumes, production are just incredible, with a real feel of authentic time travel back to 1912. Musical score also sweeping and emotional, of course with Celine Dion's favorite song and a wonderful orchestral sweep.A little more controversial is the screenplay and love story, which some commentators have portrayed as trite and even amateurish. What saves this movie, and in fact turns it into an instant classic, is that the characters are much more universal than they appear at first glance, and really have a great chemistry. Leonardo Di Caprio's Jack is an underdog orphan that has suffered great personal hardship, Kate Winslet's Rose is a young woman of great spirit completely stifled by her family and her society. You really can't help but root for them, and the chemistry between the two is absolutely fantastic. Put this story in the midst of one of the great human tragedies of the 20th century, and at the very least you have a very potent formula, even if it is not executed perfectly at every turn. Often my son and I were laughing at some of the cliches in the midst of being completely absorbed in the unfolding drama.If you love movies, you will love Titanic, it is that simple. It is an emotional, gorgeous, romantic, sexy, awesome spectacle of a movie.",9/10
"Long, boring and totally unmoving",officersmess,31 March 2000,"Special effects junkies may get something out of this film, but I found it long, very boring and totally unmoving.  The characters in general were shallow and one-dimensional;  none of the main characters were in the slightest bit likeable, and the film's potential was ruined by the extremely silly and totally fabricated central story of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" romance between Di Caprio and Winslett.  This totally implausible bit of the plot succeeds in turning this tale of a terrible human tragedy into just another trite Hollywoodisation in which only beautiful people and thwarted love count for much.  Such a shame - given the dreadful, tragic setting (which, let's face it, really did happen), it could have been a good film.......",2/10
A Captivating and Heartbreaking Journey into Tragedy,CinephileXpress,3 July 2023,"Director James Cameron's Titanic (1997) immerses viewers in the real-life tragedy of the RMS Titanic, a British ship that collided with an iceberg and met its devastating fate in the icy waters of the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912. This cinematic masterpiece successfully captures the profound sadness and gripping details surrounding this historical event, leaving audiences deeply moved. One cannot help but be overwhelmed by the sheer tragedy depicted throughout the film. Titanic delves into the depths of human emotion, highlighting the heart-wrenching loss of more than a thousand lives. The magnitude of the disaster is portrayed with utmost respect, ensuring that the viewers understand the enormity of the event without exploiting it. The movie's somber atmosphere is established through meticulous attention to detail. The haunting scenes of bodies floating in the frigid waters serve as a chilling reminder of the immense human toll and the stark reality faced by the passengers on that fateful night. These moments evoke a sense of terror and anguish, leaving a lasting impact on the audience's psyche.Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Jack, the charismatic and free-spirited artist, adds depth and vitality to the film. His performance breathes life into the narrative, allowing viewers to connect with the characters on a profound level. DiCaprio's talent shines brightly, and his chemistry with Kate Winslet, who plays Rose, is palpable, enhancing the film's emotional resonance. The final moments of Titanic are a haunting depiction of the passengers' impending doom. Many onboard, unaware of the true danger, cling to the misguided belief in the ""unsinkable ship."" These scenes poignantly illustrate the devastating realization that their lives are about to be cut short, creating a powerful and profoundly sorrowful experience.Titanic (1997) remains a timeless classic due to its ability to captivate audiences with its tragic narrative and superb performances. James Cameron masterfully weaves a tale of love, loss, and human resilience against the backdrop of a historic disaster. Prepare to be deeply moved and transported to a world where hope and tragedy collide, leaving an indelible mark on your heart.",No Rating
My biggest movie disappointment in over 35 years,Oblomov-2,27 January 2001,"First of all, as a long time student of the Titanic disaster and member of several Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I don't really care how many awards and accolades the film won, but to me it is still an absolutely awful film. Cameron had the resources to make a 'proper' semi-documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po-faced romantic mush. The fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows, to my mind, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days. Whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love? In fact most real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster certainly was not one. I feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. I almost threw up in the last sequence where the 'dead' lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause. Is this an intelligent film? Ask yourself.",1/10
A post-pubescent comment,LazarusL,26 March 1999,"Dear GOD, this movie amazed me. What amazed me more were the sheep that bought into it, and the little lambs that were allowed in. This is a movie with nudity, sex, violence and some very disturbing images that are not appropriate for young children.Ok, now on to the review. My friend dragged me to this over the march break last year, and I am only now getting past my disappointment to discuss it reasonably. To all those who think it is the greatest movie of all time I would love to know what your criteria is. Do you go by acting? Outside of Kathy Bates and some minor players, there is none. I got about as much emotion out of Leo as I did out of my hampster in her final days. Winslet was bareable, although I cannot comprehend her bearing all, unless James felt that the teen-age male was an important demographic.Now you cannot completely fault the actors, because the script was hardly anything to shout about (unless you are the ranting and raving type.) ""I have seen the iceberg and now I see it in your eyes,"" could not be any more sappy. It was full of little bits of dialogue that were laughably out of historical context, and the characters could not be more cliched... which brings me to the story itself.It was as if someone took all the period pieces about class disparity and jammed them through a meat grinder. All the juice (ie. plot and intrigue) leaked out of the bottom, and a squishy,  messy, mixed up movie was the result. The kind, young, talented pauper falls in love with the rich, testy, unhappy girl who is betroethed to the evil industrialist. Joan Collins would be impressed...Basically, if you want loud noise, and don't mind a few tits, plus you can survive 2 hours of boredom interspersed, this movie is worth it. Otherwise, you haven't hit puberty yet, or you really need to watch some real movies, like Citizen Kane or On the Waterfront.",3/10
A Story To Tell,AbhiMathews,28 July 2013,"Rarely does a story so well known by viewers surprise them so wonderfully. Everyone knows about the Titanic and the travesty that transpired, but people often forget about the lives of those involved and the experiences they endured. The story of the Titanic, the infamous ship, and two starstruck lovers, who were merely forgotten, displays vast beauty in an otherwise unfortunate event. From the characters to scenery, this movie captivates the audience with its enthralling imagery and emotional acting. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet perform incredibly in their respective roles, and demonstrate that going against the status quo is not necessarily bad. Throughout the film, viewers are taken on a journey. One that begins with Rose happily accepting Jack into her life, and then Jack tirelessly trying to stay in it. To say Titanic is a romance is an understatement. It possesses action, adventure, drama and all the like, and is far from your generic love movie. I was gladly surprised by how much I loved this film even after seeing its numerous awards and superb reviews. Titanic is a movie that will certainly not disappoint, and it is definitely one for the ages that I recommend for anyone and everyone to see.",9/10
You probably like Scream too,goregod,26 February 1999,"The Greatest film of all time? HMMM.I vowed to never watch the film, but I did. What a waste of time and 2 video cassettes. I did give the film a chance. I am a James Cameron fan, I own all of his other films on cassette. What can I say. The film was boring, the acting was horrible. DiCaprio was laughingly bad, and he actually thought he deserved an Oscar nod. Billy Zane played the best character in the film, honestly. His character was the most entertaining character.Too bad so many people were blinded by DiCaprio's looks and did see the bad acting flowing from him. The special effects were poor. C'mon, long black bars representing the night sky. Mushy looking computer generated faces put over stunt peoples faces to make them look like DiCaprio and Winslet. There is no way that DiCaprio could swim up to the surface of the water after being pulled in by such a huge undertow. The special effects guys forgot to add frozen breath in many of the sequences that take place in the frigid water. Also during that scene you can here soundstage echos. DiCaprio sure spent a lot of time talking about places he had been to, which is fine, considering they did not exsist back then. Oh yea, It was sure nice of DiCaprio to turn his back on his apparent life long best bud for Winslet. What a nice guy. Look closely as Leo enters, the dining hall, you can see the reflection of a big camera and some crew guys carrying it. And if you adjust ticket prices for inflation, Titanic is not even close to being the highest-grossing film of all time. Gone With The Wind, E.T., and even The Star Wars Trilogy would have earned more. Too many Titanic fans brag about that. Kate Winslet did not need to be naked in that film. Also, her older version in the 90's could not have remembered all those facts about the ship. Bill Paxton was wasted in this film. This is not even close to being the greatest film of all time, It is not even a good movie.Check out Reservoir Dogs, The Star Wars Trilogy, Predator, even This Boys Life (A good DiCaprio film).",1/10

It wasn't what I expected. I sat watching with slight interest, a beautiful love story but I was always anticipating the iceberg's appearance. By the time the ship did begin sinking the love story had worked it's magic, I cared for Rose and Jack, I cared for the passengers and crew and Somehow I found myself hoping against logic that the ship wouldn't sink. When Jack died and Rose begins ""1500 people went into the sea..."" I was crying harder than I'd ever cried and I've never cried at a film before or since. It just hit me like a ton of bricks that 1500 people died the same way jack did, and while jack may have never existed, those other 1500 did. Some people bash this film for the love story, but it helps the audience relate on an emotional level and offers an unforgettable experience if you open your heart to it. For the last 15 minutes or so I kept hoping it wouldn't end because I doubted any ending would be satisfactory. I was pleasantly surprised though for I consider the final scene in this film to be one of the most satisfying cinematic endings ever. When the lights came on I looked around and I can honestly say that I wasn't the only person sobbing - not by a long shot. I left the theater (at nearly midnight not the least bit tired) feeling like I had just seen the best film ever made and that I would never again see something like it. Thus far, I stand by that. I tend to find that a lot of people who don't like it, did not see it at the theater and I'm not surprised. It doesn't pack the same punch in a lit room, full of distractions and on a smaller screen. To add to that, these first time watchers are expecting to find out what all the hype was about. Bits and pieces shine through on television but the full experience is in a dark theater. Now-a-days it's cool to bash this movie. As with anything popular, there's always a backlash (look at the macarena if you want proof). This is the most successful film of all time. It is absolutely amazing how far this film reached, transcending all demographics. It was a phenomenon still unequaled and i look forward to watching it age, for it is truly a timeless classic. I doubt any of this changed anybody's opinion at all, but I hope it shed some light on mine.",10/10
"Very bad movie, frightening hype, ultimate damages.",margus-kiis,30 January 2005,"I remember the hysteria and crazy hype around the movie in 1997-98. Terrible. Normal film critics got frightened and wrote adoring lines about it. They were afraid of mad fans and Estonia is a small country you know... Plain characters, banal plot, idiotic mistakes about historical facts (Picassos famous cubist painting ""Maids of Avignon"" sank in Titanic, as you you know from the movie now!!!), huge model of the ship and big big money for brainwashing -- thats all. Artistically the movie was more a TV series cut together than movie for cinemas. And don't forget the harm the movie made for movie industry. Before it even big studios tended to make more experimental movies -- Tarantino was discovered for example. After it they all started to make stupid blockbusters, everyone wanted to make his own ""Titanic"". It all went really wrong.",1/10
#1 Film of All Time üêê,plumbcorpsystems,23 April 2023,"There will perhaps never be a film ever made again that is as enthralling, enchanting, and capturing as this one. We are delivered a unique combination of a poor charming artist, a rich engaged beauty, one of the most historic disaster events, one of the most impressive man made structures, a director known for action sequences and achieved cinematic violence, a digitally-generated achievement far before its time, and a cast of characters that roll off the screen like something out of a time capsule. The cinematography and screenplay is a large cherry atop a massive romance epic I will undoubtedly put as my favorite and #1 film of all time. Cameron delivers one for the ages, and displays how meticulous and detailed, yet simple a great American film should be made. This film should be replayed in cinema classes for generations to come.",10/10
It's About People,Hitchcoc,28 March 2006,"It's hard to believe that nearly nine years have passed since this movie came out. It's a masterpiece of special effects and storytelling, even if the romance schmaltzes it up a bit. I'm not too critical about films that stretch the truth. If that were not the case, we would only watch documentaries, and, of course, many of those are suspect. In addition to the incredible recreation of the Titanic and the people who sailed her, there is an air of mystery maintained throughout, accentuated by the incredible music score. The fact that we all know the story and the result makes us voyeurs to history. I enjoyed this movie, and yet it made me sad. I sat next to a couple of twenty something types with their baseball caps on backwards, yelling ""all right"" when a falling body would smack against an obstruction as it plummeted down the length of the capsizing ship. I sat in awe of the power of nature and imagined those poor people dying from the stupidity of an overconfident shipbuilder and captain. I know it's just a movie, but it had a really connection to my heart. The business with Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslet didn't really grab me. What did was that there was a hopelessness beyond anything we can fathom. If you read my review of ""A Night to Remember,"" also a fine film from much earlier, you will see that it's about people saying goodbye to their wives and children and to another day that makes this event so horrible. It's quite a marvelous movie. We may have forgotten that in the wake of all the attention it received, including parodies and spoofs.",9/10

"Titanic- Whilst unable to compare with 'T2, Aliens or Terminator', Titanic is nevertheless an amazing Cameron movie",illbebackreviews,1 March 2013,"All these years I've never wanted to sit down and watch this movie for various reasons. Yesterday, I just decided to randomly sit down and watch this movie, expecting nothing but a cheesy over the top romance movie. I was pleasantly surprised and blown away.As a person whose only ever seen Cameron's big three: T2, Aliens and Terminator, I never thought that any movie could ever near those three films. I have yet to see 'Avatar' which I will sometime but back to topic- Titanic blew me away as I had such low expectations.Everyone knows the story of 'Titanic', where a young boy and girl meet and fall in love. As time goes by, Titanic crashes into an iceberg causing the ship to slowly start to sink as the romance between the two gets stronger. Everyone also knows that this movie is somewhat considered one of the best and has won 11 Oscars, the most that is only tied with 'Return of the King' and 'Ben-hur'.There is so much that I love about 'Titanic' that I don't like in most romance movies. The chemistry between the two is amazing. The acting is great, the story is beautiful and emotionally gripping, the visuals are amazing, the epic scope is breath taking and the last hour is breath taking intensity after intensity. The characters are also amazing and the music is just beautiful. Cameron's writing and directing is great despite some cheesy lines such as 'I'm flying!' My main concern with Titanic before watching it was that I believed that Cameron wouldn't be up to the challenge as he is a director of action movies: T2, Aliens, Terminator, The Abyss, True Lies etc. He proved me wrong and I only love Cameron more for this! He has mastered creating epic dramas and epic romances with this movie To conclude this review here, 'Titanic' is an awesome, beautiful and emotionally gripping romance tale that is masterfully directed, brilliantly acted, with amazing visuals, a huge scope, amazing music and some great characters. The movie itself doesn't deserve to be called one of the very best nor in my opinion does it deserve the 11 Oscars it got but 'Titanic' is still....An amazing movie that everyone needs to check out!",9/10
this movie is perfection and you can't convince me otherwise.,katiefanatic-791-306918,2 October 2020,"I'm a screenwriter and i stil don't understand people's gripes with this movie. if characters saying each others names too much bothers you, this movie already lost you. it deserved all 14 oscars it was nominated for and a 15th should have gone to DiCaprio. it may explain why he speaks so poorly (or not at all) of this movie-he was not given his rightful praise. Winslet played a teenager (she was 17. yes, a teenager) trapped in an arranged betrothal not fitting into the upper class she was born into, to perfection. Dicaprio played the poor underclassmen with a compassion you need several views of this film to understand, to perfection. I've learned many new things every time I've seen this movie. (i would right? i was 12 when it came out) i saw it as such a heartbreaking love story when i first saw it, and it is that, but so much more. commentary on social class, mostly, but many other things. every time i see this film, i have a new favorite part. tonight, when it was on tv, i never paid attention to rose and jack's exchange when rose said 'i know what you must be thinking. poor little rich girl. what does she know about misery?', and jack answers 'no. i was wondering what must have happened to this girl to make her think she has no way out'. we don't have this compassion for rich people in 2020 and we should learn it.this movie is perfection on every level and the academy seemed to mostly agree. one of the few films in history you cant argue with them on.",10/10
A huge disaster.,bulleetz37235,1 September 2005,"There is more wrong with this film than anyone could possibly say. I honestly don't know where to begin. Romance is bad. Reasons.1)I am not the most knowledgeable person when it comes to romance, but isn't there more to it than nude portraits and life saving? Also where is the attraction to a guy that looks like a woman? Yes Leonardo DiCrapio acts a little effeminately to be loved as Jack Dawson our so-called hero, or at least I think that is what everyone thought he was, he isn't at all, and you know why? It is simply because that if Rose Dawson (played badly by Kate Winslet, I'll explain later) hadn't known him she would have gone home happily without losing anyone close to her, and she wouldn't have jumped, no way would she, and if she had at least the film would have been over quicker, and also he is totally repulsive, especially to the male half of the audience, I mean really who is this film for?2) Attraction. I don't know how each character was attracted to each other. How can Jack be attracted to Rose when she is spitting over the side of the ship? That's disgusting even for me, never mind an effeminate person like him. Also if it's true love why didn't Rose make more room on the floating door, which she could've done easily. He might have lived if she had, heck even Jim Carrey spotted that in the film Bruce Almighty. Acting? Reasons why it is also crap.1) Winslet acts like a snob for the first part and then like a tramp, would anybody demote themselves like this? When the kid drowned in the corridor, and when she fell off the side of the boat she hardly screamed. Why? Some say she was strong. peh... Almost everyone would have screamed in those situations. I have no idea what her face expression and posture was meant to say when Leo was arrested for possessing the planted diamond, I think she was upset, maybe angry, maybe about ready to laugh? I do not know, she had NO EXPRESSION.2) Leo was the same, NO EXPRESSION. Cameron directed people to act like gormless puppets, one face for every situation. Totally unrealistic. 3) Rose's family of snobs were stereotypical, I don't like the stereotype at all. Snobs are not just money-grabbers, I am not particularly rich, but I'd like to be. With the way that each stereotype acted, it seemed that the poor wanted to stay poor, and the rich wanted to be richer. I don't think people really act like this. The directing is bad. Reasons.1) James Cameron couldn't direct traffic. His style is crap, and revolves around two kind of people a) People who have one prime desire, and nothing else, and this doesn't remotely resemble reality at all - b) The other group are people who have one stereotyped personality. These are mainly Snobs, the poor and the ship staff. James Cameron should have worked to establish more realism within his characters, only Kathy Bates can be praised for achieving this.2) The special effects are too lavish. The boat is too glammed up, and anyone who says the boat looks ""real"" is a total moron. A film needs to be more than special effects. He could have worked a little harder on the acting instead.3) Cameron's camera shots were mediocre to say the least. A few shots that were particularly bad include. The one where he shows us the whole ship from far out, I do not know what he was trying to achieve, my guess is that he was trying to show us how isolated the ship was, but this is pointless as we already knew it was isolated, you can't get more isolated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Another example of camera shots is to do with the exchange of angles. He too often flickers back from person to person, why can't he keep the camera in one place? He may as well have pointed it at the moon, that's more interesting than a random mess of pictures. Bad plot. Reasons.It is meant to be Rose's story, and I think it should have only included her accounts. But instead it had bits that made no sense. such as.1)The two old people cuddling, getting ready to die. 2)Plates falling from shelves. 3)The captain drowning on the bridge. 4)The dome shatters and everyone inside drowns These events are shown, yet in accordance to where Rose is during the film it doesn't make sense that she should have known about these things. Why add bits? My guess is to add to the sentimentality and drama but the overall realism and straightforwardness is lost thanks to this. Boy I hate this film. Oscars? It Shouldn't have won a single solitary thing, never mind 11. There are flaws. Bigguns. No denying it really, it is totally true that almost every aspect could have been cleaned up considerably.I don't care what anyone says. I find it unbearable to watch this garbage. There is a lot more than this, wrong with this diabolical film, but I have a 1000 word limit. So all I can really say to conclude is that this film for me if not for you - SANK.",1/10
Boring,Peter T. Movie,4 January 1999,"Let's face it, nobody wants to spend three hours in a movie theater anymore (except those people who have no lives). This film was too long and drawn out.

Terminator 1912,passenger70,5 January 2020,In Titanic (T3) James Cameron unwittingly remakes his first hit The Terminator. In both films a couple struggle to escape an unstoppable machine which is on a relentless course to destroy them. Only the girl survives but it is unknown whether Kate is pregnant with a child who will save all mankind. In this case I guess it means the iceberg is Skynet since it programs the Titanic on its mission to take them down.,8/10
great film wrong cast,lindee,6 August 2006,"I loved the story but felt that Leo De caprio was miss cast he was too young looking to play the part, and Kate Winslet was too mature looking to fall for him, after all we all knew the ending but there was no real sexual chemistry between the pair no bite, and it showed in the film it was a script that any actor could have done because the history of the tragedy sold the film not who appeared in it I personally would have chose, Colin Firth to play the male lead part, don't get me wrong caprio was brilliant in the Mask, beach but he did not suite the Titanic, the special effects were brilliant and educational for history purposes you can't go wrong, because the scene where he draws her naked made you squirm had he seemed too young to be there",7/10
"One of the least creative pieces of film ,one star",brewsterlewster,20 June 2003,"I really just wanted to vote on this film.  Contrary to what many say, this film does deserve the worst ratings and does NOT deserve to be in the top 250 or 500 or 5,000,000 (including Hollywood and Bollywood).  Come on people, get some life experience and develop the right side of that brain!!!",1/10
"Boy Meets Girl, Ship Meets Ice, Movie Founders in Banality",Oct,24 March 2002,"Evidently the reputation of this blockbuster continues to nosedive, like the ship, and like DiCaprio's standing as he loses his teenybopper following. He has failed to grow out of his chrysalis (will he ever? Tom Cruise is pushing 40 and still coming on like a 20 year old). I feel the movie sets up quite an intriguing fictional frame quite skilfully in the first 20-odd minutes- not unlike 'King Kong'- and then blows it the moment Rose's mother utters the words we're all praying not to hear: ""They say she's unsinkable"". More's the pity, this comes just after the amusing tease of not showing Rose as she alights from the cab until we've peered under her big Edwardian hat.From then on, dialogue cliches, anachronisms, falsifications of historical fact, national stereotypes and the absurdities and contrivances of the plot pile up until the film's credibility is foundering long before the vessel does. Why do the lovers make out in a car (is this a first?) when she could have smuggled him into her stateroom with its four-poster bed? Note too how in between their 1990s-style bursts of nookie the star-crossed pair manage to be on hand for every plot development. It's Rose who quizzes an admiring Andrews about the lifeboats' capacity, and she and Jack are snogging at the very moment of impact- which is far more juddery than in reality, since few passengers noticed it. Somehow Rose wades through freezing water for minutes on end, clad in her filmy dress, without taking any harm: I know Dame Winslet's naturally well insulated, but not even a sneeze?It's beyond a joke when Murdoch, a gallant officer, is smeared as a corrupt suicide: Cameron had to pay $8,000 to charity to make up for that bit of hokum. But many of the errors are venial, and some grisly enjoyment can be drawn from the spectacle of multiple death, just as a little can be had from the curiously cursory contemplation of the ship's luxurious appointments in the earlier scenes, which experts have warranted authentic.On the whole, though, sitting through these three hours feels like being forced to drink an enormous, sickly cocktail. For relief, try the pure draught of iceberg-cold water provided by the British antidote: Eric Ambler's and Roy Ward Baker's 'A Night to Remember', which sticks to documentary reconstruction and distils more pity, terror and catharsis than Mr Cameron's $200m budget and tin ear could begin to generate.PS: When people rave about 'Titanic's' box office- as if numbers guaranteed quality- tell them that inflated 1997 ticket prices are responsible for most of it. Tickets sold ('bums on seats') for the great popular epics of the past, such as 'Gone with the Wind', were far more numerous.",No Rating
The Sinking Ship,bigben-3,14 May 1999,"Titanic, for many of us, maybe one of the great films ever made, I beg to differ. Seeing this movie for the first time did not really gave me the intense and impact as it did on millions and millions of us. To be honest, I find this movie boring and really a waste of more than 3 hours.The story is so much predictable. You can even guess what would happen, and even what's the ending. Performances, I must admit, are quite impressing. Billy Zane and Kathy Bates delivers a stand-out performances. Leonardo and Kate, also did well on this film, but truly neither of them deserves an Oscar. James Cameron, as far directing is concern, really deserves his Oscar. Effects on this film are also great, especially when the ship is sinking, but most of the time I find it lame. To sum up, this film has its own highlights, but truly I don't consider this as one of the greatest films.",No Rating
I love it!,MxS7HGS,4 December 2023,"The film captivated me and amazed me. No wonder this movie was a hit - James Cameron knows how to make must-see films for the cinema. This movie brings together romance and action. The realism is so convincing that every moment is captivating. The scene where the boat is loaded is one of the most unforgettable in any film. The thrilling and memorable parts of the movie made me forget about how dull and simple the scene of the sinking was at the beginning. Along with the fear, there were also humorous moments, like when Jack and Rose tell an obsequious man to ""shut up."" Old Rose appears unimpressed when she reveals that Cal took his own life. The scene shifts to the exploration team after Rose narrates the tale behind the nude drawing. It is truly a great film.Many people argue about whether both individuals had the possibility of escaping in the end. Nevertheless, the actual issue lies in the fogging up of the car due to their intimate activities. The car wasn't enclosed and had three walls and one open side, enabling steam to escape. James had many scientific advisors on set, so why didn't he hire an experienced professional to address this problem?",9/10

""Titanic"" is a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly combines epic romance and heart-wrenching tragedy.

despite the risk of death i wanna go back 2 titanic!,ParanoiaPoliticianDiva77,4 February 2006,"I'm a sucker 4 romance, history and Leonardo DiCaprio, so this movie captivated me, it felt like u were there, on the doomed ship, the beauty and elegance of the 1st class captivated me while the fun and free steerage party made me want 2 dance. the romance was so carefully done and i loved it, the drawing was sensual and romantic-it was done so every single girl was left wishing their boyfriends were amazing artists as well. my only complaint was ""my heart will go on"" it was a cute song but Celine Dion-while writing it should not have sung it-sorry but she cant sing and with that one song has turned all my guy-friends from watching the movie (which sux because its my fave movie and now wen we watch movies at each others houses we cant watch titanic as they r now agsinst the soundtrack) when the ship is sinking its amazing the way you feel for the people falling off (except for the lady who slid down it and flashed everyone and the guy who fell off the end and fell on the propellers-those were funny and provided comic relief) but the way you just felt sad for the lady with the baby asking the captain for help, murdoch feeling helpless and shooting himself, fabritzio getting killed by the funnels and tommy Ryan getting shot. Kate Winslet gives an unforgettably performance and i suggest she dyes her hair that colour again because its so gorgeous. i loved what she wore and i bet every girl wishes they had her wardrobe (before the sinking obviously). Leonardo DiCaprio was impeccable as the (sexy) penniless artist who teaches rose how to love and gives her the courage to ""never let go"" this is a bawl your eyes out movie and is not to be missed",10/10
Beautiful and haunting. Truly epic on every scale.,blacklist-1,11 April 2010,"I must say I'm surprised at the low IMDb rating of 7.3 and that there are a lot of negative reviews on this website. But compared with millions loving this and winner of 11 academy awards, those voices of discontent against this film are left in the shade. Arguably for me James Cameron's greatest film. Titanic is a true epic of colossal scale. The acting is brilliant particularly with Leonardo Decaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose. They light up the screen as the two lovers separated by social class but not love. There romance is so beautifully depicted that you can't help but smile. The romantic story set aside the sinking is flawlessly intertwined.Though the film is in two parts the romance and the sinking the first hour and a half gives you the chance to come to know these two characters and others like nasty Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) and LoveJoy (David Warner) who play there parts excellently well with great support from Kathy Bates who plays the lively Molly Brown. There are some beautiful and forever memorable scenes between Jack and Rose when Jack first sees her, the third class party, when they kiss on the bow of the ship, Jack painting her naked, when they make love in the car and when they are both in the water after the ship has sunk and Jack dies. All these scenes and others are amazing. The music score by James Horner is hauntingly beautiful and sombre and made me cry when you see the full sinking in all it's horror.And you do James Cameron depicts everything showing not just the sinking from Jack and Roses perspective but different people in different parts of the ship as they scream desperately for help. So you end up caring not just for the main characters but all the small cameo roles played by hundreds of people. Morality questions are raised about how things were handled by white star liner. These are haunting images that burn in your mind and stay with you long after. The most haunting scene is when loads of passengers are in the water and when most of them had died. The cameras focusing on one of the lifeboats coming back is the ethereal feel of a mythic force. Cameron creates suspense and tension at whether the two lovers will survive and you just deeply care about them. The costumes and ship itself look simply magnificent and are a wonder to look at. The end scene as well where the old Rose dies in her sleep and has the happy memory of marrying Jack on Titanic and when he dies in the water made me cry my eyes out and is one of the best scenes I have ever seen in film. Titanic is a epic film and James Cameron has shown this disaster in all it's horror and is a tribute to the victims of this tragedy. In 2012 there has been a rumour that he is going to re-release the film in 3D. It will be even more incredible no doubt (he proved that with Avatar) but it's the storytelling,which will recapture the myth of this fascinating tale that has been told throughout world generations. Even now as one reviewer Baybee from Austrailia quotes about Titanic the film.""This would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th century and one that will never be forgotten""I couldn't have put it better myself. Even after watching this time after time the film still has that powerful impact of making me feel sad. Truly remarkable.",10/10
MOST HEARTBREAKING MOVIE,shielamaetapao,9 February 2019,I watched this movie and I fell inlove with Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Jane Winslet) with their outstanding act. It's the most heartbreaking movie I have ever watched my entire life and until now I can't move on.It's like watching a love story and turns into tragedy. Imagine that? How hurtful it is if you were at the Titanic and seeing your love dies. It is so painful but still worth to watch especially if you like sad endings. This is what you've been looking for!!!,10/10
Ready to go Back to Titanic,thesar-2,3 March 2013,"When James Cameron staple, Bill Paxton, uttered the words: ""Are you ready to go back to Titanic?"" I hadn't actually been sure as of late. For, I've seen it three times in the theatres back in 97/98 and maybe once more on VHS a year or two later. I've had the score and ""song"" memorized since and, of course, I knew the outcome.Well, when the movie opened, I felt more than ready. Gone were the thoughts: ""Be prepared, this is three plus hours"" and I was once again mesmerized from minute one all the way until minute 194. This near-masterpiece made me miss how movies are supposed to made: with heart and talent. And that year, plenty were: some of other best picture nominations, L.A. Confidential, Good Will Hunting, and As Good as it Gets, were also utterly fantastic. Sadly, since 1997, we're lucky to have ONE made with such heart and incredible talent per year.By now, everyone knows the story and has since copied it multiple times. Let me make this clear: VERY few have made one with such a great script with believable dialogue, excellent actors and above all-else, chemistry. Kate and Leo had it in spades. From the second Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) looked up when new-friend, Tommy (Jason Barry) was talking to him, and saw Rose (Kate Winslet,) I KNEW they captured true love.Since this movie arrived 15 years ago, I've been a pretty good fan of Kate, but not so much Leo. He suffers from Denzelitis whereas almost every role he performs, he's not trying to act; he's JUST trying to win an Oscar. This annoying habit leads to way too much over-acting and an abundance of screaming. (SEE: practically any Leo or Denzel Washington role since 1997.)But...Leo pulled it off here. Truly, he showed such a deep affection, love and purity towards his costar that I believed every word, every action and that Rose's heart will go on. He did it so well, with each viewing, I always envisioned her life, the rest of it from the Titanic sinking until her death with him in her heart.These two, Rose and Jack amongst a few other decent characters, namely the fantastic Kathy Bates as The Unsinkable Molly Brown, were so good and deep that I never mind that it's about an hour and a half or more before the ""special effects"" kick in. I.E. The ship sinks. (Oops, sorry, spoiler.)That's the genius of James Cameron. His heart and soul was in this project. He nearly bankrupted the studio and himself and practically gave himself a bad name prior to opening ‚Äì which was rescheduled more than once. He didn't just make an hour and half retelling of a sinking ship, even though he had the technology. And he didn't just put two romantic leads together; he made sure that the fictional love backdrop was as real as the amazing sinkage.To give an example of an ""epic"" retelling following Titanic that did not have the qualities needed to further an ""opening buildup"" of a romance is Peter Jackson's King Kong. It was flat, boring and unconvincing. He sure had the talent ‚Äì Kong looked real, but sadly that CGI character held the most depth in the movie.Beyond the romance ‚Äì that, yes, made me tear again after all these years/viewings and only because I believed the true love before me, was the ultimate score, one of the best songs, movie hit or not, excellent dialogue spoken ‚Äì mostly by Leo and Molly Brown, great special effects and breathtaking cinematography. I had to see this on the big screen again, although I would've MOST preferred to have the option of 2-D.I would love to see a new movie of such deep quality and soul like this spend a deserved 15-weeks at number one at the box office that I would strongly stand behind. Recently, The Hunger Games did a decent four weeks at number one, and the highly inferior to both movies, Avatar, did seven. But both were just simple blockbusters. Not heart-felt movies. Not movies I would rate 5/5 stars ‚Äì my highest honor of reviews.Sadly, James Cameron's follow-up, the Space Gully with Wolves film, Avatar, brought down Titanic's mind-blowing record box-office receipts. Oh, how I wished with the 2012 re-release with the ""ho-hum"" 3-D format would've have reclaimed the top spot. But it isn't to happen. And that's okay. It's still a great movie, still holds up today, still makes me laugh and cry and still makes me feel love all over again for movie making. If you are one of the six people in the world that hasn't seen it, SEE TITANIC.Side Note: Way back in the day, when internet was really just kick starting and we had things like ""I.M.'ing"" each other, I was involved in a long-distance relationship and I actually typed out C√©line Dion's song, My Heart Will Go On to my partner that thoroughly made him blush.Side Note II: As stated, I watched this three times in the theatre following its initial release. On the last turn, I was on a first date with a guy ‚Äì against all warnings from my friends to make Titanic a ""first date"" movie. Well, it did turn out to be the first and last date. This was his first viewing of Titanic and still, he fell asleep around hour one and awoke right before (spoiler!) Jack dies. I know my date was awoken because his snores stopped and he instantly began weeping. Frustrated, I said in a normal voice, despite being in the theatre, ""What do you have to be crying about?

PFFT!! OVER RATED!!!,outonly,6 July 2000,"Seriously, this could not have made that much money, it is one of the worst movies I have seen, not the worst though. It is VERY over rated though. There isn't much to this movie, and story line is sooooo corny. Rose DeWitt Bukater, Kate Winslet's character is to me, a floozy! The only good part was when they were all dying, that was funny. Otherwise, this isn't a romantic movie, Romeo and Juliet, even though they both die is romantic, but this is not. It is an exploitation of the titanic disaster, and that is it. Want to watch a real movie, watch American Beauty, or Pulp Fiction, or Eyes Wide Shut, or The Good The Bad and The Ugly.",1/10
Nothing on Earth Could Come Between Them.,ikizdevran-882-254684,1 July 2018,"Titanic, the largest moving object of her time hit an iceberg and sank on her maiden voyage leaving untold stories behind. When she was found on the ocean floor she was still facing west. The china have never been used, the sheets have never been slept in. Titanic was called the ship of dreams. It set sail on 10 April 1912 from Southampton and sank on 14 April 1912 hitting an iceberg. James Cameron took an interest in this story because of his passion for shipwrecks. He calls Titanic as ""Mount Everest of shipwrecks."" In the film, treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) shares the very same passion for a different reason. He is searching for a priceless diamond called ""Heart of the Ocean"" in the wreck of Titanic. During this search he discovers a drawing of a young woman wearing nothing but that diamond. This woman turns out to be still alive at the age of 101 and has a different story to tell about the ill-fated ship.Back in its time Titanic was the most expensive film that has ever been made. Its budget was estimated $200 million. It grossed worldwide $1.84 billion which made Titanic the first film to hit billion-dollar mark. We all know how the film is going to end and yet again we watch. Even more important, James Cameron convinces the production company to invest $200 Million in a film which is about a ship that is going to sink and a sequel is not even possible. One logical explanation to all this madness is, he really believed in Titanic and his own talents as a director, writer and producer. Of course, I haven't forgotten his high-rated films like The Terminator, The Terminator II, Aliens and The Abyss. All those films were a great reference for Titanic, but I believe with a possible failure, his career would have ended forever. He took the risk and it worked. Faith in Titanic made him the king of the world. He is still one of the most successful directors of all time. Titanic won 11 Oscars out of 14 nominations making it the film with the most Oscars won by a single film.James Cameron used latest cinema technology to make Titanic. He even waited for years for this film to be possible. But the story he is telling is a simple one. It is a love story between two people from different social classes. What makes this classic drama a special one is that it is happening in a ship which is going to sink and a lot of people will die including the boy. He wanted his audience to really feel what it was really like to be on Titanic. He took a turn from the story and showed us some powerful scenes to reflect that tragedy to its limits. This is one of the strongest points of Titanic. In 195 minutes, audience feels every human emotion possible. In the film, James Cameron uses the power of soundtracks, intelligent conversations and non-verbal scenes to bring us where he wants us to be.The love between Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) happens within four days but echoes to the eternity. This is why one of the taglines of the film is ""Nothing on Earth Could Come Between Them."" You can still see the love and passion in the eyes of old Rose while telling her story after 84 years like it happened yesterday. In this point of view the transmission of all the emotions through Rose to the audience is another strong point of the film. It makes people believe and show sympathy in her story. This makes sinking the ship even harder but it must happen. Drama is the main genre of Titanic. After drama it comes romance because there is a great love, acting and chemistry between Rose and Jack. These extraordinary performances helped Titanic become one of the greatest films of cinema history. The success of the film opened the way to stardom both for Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio.While knitting his story inch by inch, James Cameron takes a moment to point out how rotten our society is with its gaps between social classes. In the night of the accident 1503 recorded passengers lost their lives. This number could have been much less if the lifeboats would have been filled up to its limits. It is shown that some of the lifeboats sailed with little people because the comfort of first-class people was still a priority.Showing real scenes from the Titanic and combining them with the film was brilliant. I have also enjoyed the shooting of the iconic scene where Jack holds Rose from behind at the edge of the ship opening their hands. We see them from different camera angles. If you pay attention there are quite a few scenes that gave the audience goosebumps and this is only possible with a good cinematography. So here is a special thanks to Russell Carpenter.Casting to the soundtracks, Titanic is a work of passion. It is one of the few films that combines a real story with a work of fiction in an artistic way. Films like this can be made but they can't be made perfect. James Cameron managed to make it perfect.",9/10
"A Film So Big It Could Only Be Called ""Titanic""",tfrizzell,25 June 2000,"Wow.  ""Titanic"" soars effortlessly through 3 hours and 15 minutes and yet you are not exhausted or tired at all.  In fact you may be wanting more by the end.  James Cameron reached new heights with this film and will always be remembered as the man who directed ""Titanic"".  From top to bottom the film is almost perfect.  Its special effects and minute details make it a real treasure to behold.  One feels as if they are really on that doomed liner.  The characters are excellent as well.  Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart delivered Oscar-nominated performances.  Overlooked, but equally potent was Billy Zane in a well-calibrated role.  However, Leonardo DiCaprio is just there it seems.  His character has mindless dialogue that does become tiring at times.  Despite that small problem it is not enough to keep ""Titanic"" from easily being one of the best films of the 1990s.  5 stars out of 5.",No Rating
Better than all the rest,Boyo-2,20 January 1999,"I've seen quite a lot of movies in my life, but ""Titanic"" stands alone.  It is the most amazing, beautiful, heartbreaking movie ever made.  The final scene broke my heart into a thousand pieces.  I love this movie very much and always will.",10/10

Has all the right elements to be a great romance movie for the mainstream audience,KineticSeoul,6 June 2012,"I saw this movie when it first came out in theater and the whole theater was packed and for good reason. This has many elements to make a good romance movie, yeah it gets a bit sappy and corny but that is passable. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie when it first came out but acted like I hated it for the sake of hating it. Because it came out sometime when I was in elementary school and all the kids back then was making fun of this movie. Although some of them probably enjoyed watching this movie as well. This is the movie that made Leonardo DiCaprio and made him a teenage heartthrob. So the plot is basically this to put it simply, it's about a romance that blossoms on a ship called Titanic between a poor guy named name Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCario) and Rose(Kate Winslet). But Rose is engaged to a douche but the romance between Jack and Rose increases even during the sinking of the ship. I am not giving anything away since anyone that knows a bit of history knows that the Titanic sank. And when the human nature when it comes to survival kicks in, that is done in a pretty realistic manner. Even if the romance aspect of this movie is pretty straightforward but at least it's engaging and that is what matters. Everything from the cinematography to special effects were phenomenal for a movie from the late 90's and it's still spot on today. I finally got the chance to see this movie in 3D again and it was still good. And the conversion to 3D is done well.7.9/10",7/10
Dreadful!,vic-232,20 June 2008,"So, how do you spend vast amounts of money on a film and still wind up with a dreadful (albeit profitable) end product? Simple.You spend lots of money on beautiful sets and breathtaking special effects. You hire some very talented and/or (mostly or) attractive actors. Then you give those actors lines to speak that are so badly written they might have been written by a 13-year-old girl trying to emulate a Harlequin romance.Despite wonderful production values and a serviceable story line, ""Titanic"" may be painful to the ears of anybody who is fully literate. Why did James Cameron spend so many millions to make a film and not spend an extra ten grand to have a competent editor look at his script? Writing the ""Terminator"" movies really was NOT adequate preparation for writing an epic romance.Gag me with a spoon! (Hmmm... did Kate Winslet's character say something like that in what was supposed to be 1912? Quite possibly!)",2/10
"Titanic and Avatar: Two Films Hated Because of ""Simple"" Plots",Caesarboy5,24 December 2013,"Titanic and Avatar are very different. One is about a forbidden love aboard a doomed ship. The other is about humans trying to exploit an alien race in order to profit. Yet both have something very similar in common: they are criticized for having unoriginal stories.Titanic is a love story about a doomed couple. People complain that it's been done before (Romeo and Juliet) and that it's boring. They only enjoy the second half which consists of everyone dying. I'm here to say that is an unfair call.THE GOODThere's nothing wrong with an unoriginal story, as long as the execution is good. After all, we're running out of original stories. Even Shakespeare had a tendency to take other people's stories. He just told them really well. So, is Titanic well executed? yes, on the most part. While it does have it's flaws, I think the bulk of the film is amazing. It's well paced, the characters are well-developed, the cinematography is awe-inspiring, and the conflict is one that continues to exist today (people being forced into loveless relationships due to different pressures). Like Romeo and Juliet, this film is a classic.THE BADThis is a nitpick. Cameron decided to make the film as if an older Rose is telling a captain the story via flashback. That's fine and it works well the entire film. But the ending is just rushed and not much of a lesson like ti should have been. The Captain of the submarine crew should have disposed of the Heart of the Ocean, not Rose. That way it would show Rose's lesson got through to someone. Why even introduce the Captain and a conflict if they're just going to be forgotten at the end of the film.Once again, a nitpick, but the movie is three hours. Why is the ending so rushed? I just wished they could have gave the future part of the film a more satisfying ending.VERDICTGreat film, 9/10, see it! Whether you'll like it or hate it, this is one of the four essentials of the 90's, along with Pulp Fiction, Terminator 2, and Forrest Gump.",9/10
worst movie ever made,RJ-21,26 November 1998,"I've seen some shockers in my time, but this excuse for a film takes the cake.  I had some respect for Cameron and Winslet before this one, but all that was ruined by Titanic.  Easily the Academy's biggest mistake of recent years, and certainly the aforementioned film stars. (I had little respect for DiCaprio, however, so he isn't tainted any more) Billy Zane must have been desperate, as even if he's not the best actor around, he's still a popular choice for me. A script that couldn't have been recycled into toilet paper, combined with bad acting and a bad story make Titanic a disaster, rather than a disaster movie.  For a good romance, check The Princess Bride, and for disaster, see a good war movie - try Gallipoli.",1/10
Beautiful and moving,femaleanimefan,27 February 2007,"When it comes to pure visual spectacle, Titanic is one of the best movies ever made. But the love story is great as well. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have such wonderful chemistry that it makes the occasionally poor dialogue tolerable. Their scenes together are some of the most memorable moments in romantic movie history.However, the visuals steal the show. The scenes of the Titanic sinking are some of the most beautiful yet terrible scenes ever filmed. Beautiful because it looks so real, and terrible because we know this actually happened. But that's not to say the love story is shoved into the background. The romance takes up most of the film, and their tragic ending is one that is sure to draw tears from the sensitive ones.Overall, the film is well-acted, visually masterful, and unforgettably romantic. By now, it is an absolute classic and, in my opinion, it certainly deserved it's Best Picture win at the Oscars.",2/10
"Once they hit the iceberg, it's great",pmtelefon,21 February 2021,"Disaster movies might be my favorite genre. There's a simple formula to these movies: the first half hour is the set-up and then the roof caves in. Writer/director/producer James Cameron missed the memo. Cameron takes over an hour and a half to get to the meat and potatoes. It's time wasted. The first half of ""Titanic"" is long and tedious. The bookend story isn't that interesting. The voyage stuff is pure melodrama. The dialogue is corny with way too much ""explaining"". That stuff is informative but it never sounds real. For some reason the strong cast isn't very good either. Overall, they get a grade of C+. It's when ""Titanic"" hits the iceberg that the movie really comes alive. It's exciting and very emotional. The last hour or so is classic. I saw ""Titanic"" twice in the theater. Once when it first came out and the other time was for its 3D re-release. I've also seen it a bunch of times at home (including tonight). I don't watch it as often as I did because I'm starting to really dislike the first half. Dishonorable mention: Kate Winslet's less than thrilling nude scene.",7/10

Universal appeal,CubsandCulture,8 February 2019,"I think what I most admire about this film is how it is accessible to everyone. If you are interested in romance it has an earnest love triangle that is structured like a classic melodrama, i.e. Woman caught between the poor guy who represents liberation and the rich guy who represents safety. If you are interested in history it handles the Titanic story in a straight forward way and all the well known aspects are covered, i.e. The band playing during the sinking. If you are an action fan the actual sinking is quite impressive and engaging. If you are interested in cinematic techniques the film is a showcase of then cutting edge effects. And if you are so inclined to be snarky about any of that the film let's you be with relative ease. None of these threads really dominate the film and Cameron does a great job balancing all of them. I don't think everyone will like this film but I can't imagine how somehow would utterly hate it; it is harmless and there are so many worse films to slag on..For my money I rather enjoy the old fashioned spirit and how earnest the film is. Both because it is fun to be snarky about Jack and Rose. (JACK! ROSE!). But more often than not I rather get swept up in the melodrama. I utter aware of the writing issues and yet I still feel melancholy at the end of the film.On my last re-watch I was struck by how well the special effects have stood up over time. There are shots/effects here and there that no longer work fully but on the whole the film presents the sinking and the like in a very believable way. Cameron does a great job of mixing up the illusions to make it all work.Yes this is a middle brow film; but films that capture the industry's attention and the public's awe tend to be middlebrow.",10/10
Easily the best film of 97 and a classic that will stand the test of time,baumer,12 August 1999,"Warning: may be some small spoilers.I have always been a James Cameron fan. He is really one of the only directors I can say that has never made a bad film. Even his Piranha 2 was humorous and a fine effort coming from such a young director with a small budget. He has made, from what I can recall, two masterpieces (Aliens and Terminator 2) a genre pioneer (Terminator) and one of the best action movies to come out in the 90's ( True Lies ) and an ambitious touching film ( The Abyss ). But now he has outdone himself with Titanic. I don't think there has ever been a film that has taken me through such a wide array of emotions as this one. And that is all attributed to Cameron. He wrote, produced and directed this film. And it is one of the best films ever made.We all know the story of Titanic. A great ship sets sail for the U.S. from the U.K. and along the way it sinks and many people lost their lives in the Atlantic somewhere near Newfoundland. So there is no need to retell those events documentary style. A Night To Remember is there for that purpose. So what Cameron's Titanic does is tells the tale of fictitious characters blended in with real ones amidst the real events of the sinking. And it not only makes the film entertaining, it shows the sheer horror of what happened that night and makes you more sympathetic to the characters because you spend three hours with them. This is a brilliant, brilliant film.To start with, the actors are perfect. Not just DiCaprio and Winslet, but everyone from Zane and Bates right down to Paxton as the present day treasure hunter. But it is Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that are the true stars here as it the two of them that have to carry the load and make us care about them. And we do. We can feel them falling in love. We can feel the helpless emotions that Jack feels when he is trying to tell Rose that he loves her the day of the sinking. It is their relationship that is a great strength of the film.Next, what has to be mentioned is the score by James Horner. Very few times has a motion picture had a score that symbolized the sheer hopelessness and tragedy that is on screen. But here Horner has a perfect and somber piece of music that will bring tears to your eyes, especially when lives and love are lost.Also, the whole scope of the film is one of tragedy. It is a tragic love story, a tragic story of refugees trying to make a better life for themselves and have it all end abruptly with a giant piece of ice. It is a sad look at bureaucracy and wealth and how it can manipulate and control many things.But most importantly, this is a love story and an inspirational tearjerker. Rose and Jack fall fast and hard and it doesn't matter that they are from different worlds. Love sees no boundaries. If it is there, nothing can stop it. Not even death.Titanic is perfect in every sense. And as a guy, it is my duty not to cry in movies. I know how ridiculously old fashioned that sounds but it is true. We just aren't supposed to. But I left my testosterone at the door and when I finally let go, I found myself brought to tears as the scenes of children clinging for life in the frigid waters would be enough to bring the strongest man to tears. Cameron has manipulated us to perfection here and even if you find the romance to be embellished (which I don't) to watch this film and know that this happened, is a sad and disturbing reality. Few films have ever done this to me. Few have ever made me feel such a connection to the characters. Titanic does, and by the end of the film, you feel like you know the people of Titanic like they were your long lost relatives. And one final note: I can't understand how anyone could not enjoy the film, that's just me. But I know that what moves some does nothing for others. But the backlash towards this film is not necessary. Not every film has to be Ramboesque. Not every film has to be filled with explosions. I am not opposed to those films, I actually love many of them, but I am also prone to well written stories, whether they are love stories or not. Those who criticize this film need to realize that there is a market for this. The gross for this film and the demographics it appealed to confirm that.As for the comment made earlier about those of us that enjoyed it being teens and have never seen a film before 1990, well I am 27, my brother is 24, my mom is 50 something and my grandmother is in her 80's. And we all loved it. So keep that in mind. And a film does not gross 2 BILLION dollars by having only teens see it.This is as good as a film gets!One final note. The SE DVD finally came out and it was worth the wait. The transfer is beautiful and if you are like me and love DVD's so you can access the special features, then this disc is for you. The commentary alone by Cameron makes the disc worth spending your money on. Cameron doesn't do a lot of commentaries, but the ones he does are perhaps the most insightful commentaries out there. Titanic, he outdoes himself. I really recommend everyone who loves this film to get the SE DVD and just sti back for 3 hours and listen to what he has to say.",10/10
"I am firmly in the ""I didn't like it"" camp.",jasongibbonsxxx,19 September 2010,"I did not like Titanic. I thought the acting was way way way over the top, it definitely was not historically accurate, and the whole old-woman-with-the-valuable-necklace thing was just way too over the top. I am a fan of Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet (I think she's maybe the best actress working today in films) but I couldn't stand this movie. The fact that is was so very over-hyped to me by my girlfriend at the time who saw it with her friends before dragging me to go see it did not help probably. The action was pretty good with great effects of the boat sailing the ocean and especially during the sinking scenes, but it felt very long and was trying way too hard to pluck at heartstrings. I don't understand why the leads had to have the fate that they did, don't want to spoil it but if you've seen it I think you know what I mean when I say why couldn't she share the furniture? Overacting, overly desperate to cause us to have an emotional reaction, I think it will go down as a well produced movie that was too basic a story, an unoriginal love story, and way over-hyped because for some reason a lot of people loved it when it came out.",No Rating
A Mysterious Sinking,Local Hero,7 February 2001,"Trying to get beyond all the hype-- the ludicrous praise and the vehement reaction against-- I tried to rate this movie objectively, and and in doing so I gave it a three out of ten. It is not the worst movie ever made, and it's certainly not the best. Some nice special effects. Hackneyed two-dimensional characters and dialogue written for early teens, but not particularly offensive. Can be watched from start to finish once with only a dozen or so moments of cringing.However, what did sink right along with that ship was the prestige of the Oscar Award itself. Now the Oscars have given out silly ""Best Pictures"" in the past, and there has always been a creeping element of the Grammies' ""popularity contest"" about them that kept them from ever getting too ""high brow""; but with the choosing of ""Titanic"" as the Best Picture for 1997, I honestly believe that the Academy did serious damage to its reputation for many years to come. Previously, serious film lovers knew that while the Oscars certainly weren't a foolproof measure of quality; in retrospect, they have produced a list of the greatest films that, on the whole, stands the test of time just as well as any list created by the Cannes, Venice, Berlin or Toronto film festivals. But this year (1997) changed everything. Not only did they overlook one of the best films of the decade (""L.A. Confidential""), but they made an obvious bow to box office as a ratings ploy and lowest-common-denominator crowd pleaser. With time, the decision to crown an overgrown adolescent throwaway flick the best movie of the year will haunt them mercilessly-- if it doesn't already.",3/10

Cannily-made picture is, of course, full of marvelous effects, but its this key romance that most people will end up remembering (and with good reason, as the performers are terrific).

As much as I didn't want to give in, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio make a great, old fashioned, star crossed romantic couple. Many of the effects and stunts are amazing (although at other times you realize some wide shots are basically giant video-game like cartoons). And it made me cry -- while I felt like a fool for being swept up in it's shameless melodrama.

The Movie about people who make stupid choices and the ships that punish them,questl-18592,29 October 2021,"So, bit of backstory for me and this movie. When I was but a wee moviegoer my birthday came around and there were two big movies playing: Titanic and Flubber. At that age? I wanted to see Flubber, hands down, no question. We saw Titanic. Ever since then, I've had something of an unfair distaste for this one but recently I thought, ""It's been years, Cameron made it... I need to give it a fair chance.""Well, I can comfortably say that while I don't think it's for me, I was unfair to this as a child. It really lives up to the Cameron pedigree of being just absolutely gorgeous. The way he made that ship feel, the size of it, the grandeur is just the kind of master craft we come to expect of the man. The cast deliver solid performances throughout, there's a proper sense of drama, even though we all know how it's going to play out.Where it loses me is in the over-the-top nature of the love story. It feels like he's going for a Shakespearean, Romeo and Juliet type of romance epic and I just can't help but feel it's over the top. Beyond that, I could really do without the whole modern aspect of the story. I just feel like it slows stuff down and doesn't really bring anything to the story.Whelp, child me was wrong. This is a pretty solid movie, stunning to look at but is a little too cloying for my tastes still. I will no longer actively avoid it, won't flip the channel if it happens to be on. Can't say I'll be seeking it out again anytime soon, but who knows.",6/10
a dramatic and engaging love story,Stampsfightclub,12 January 2008,"Kate Winslet (Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind) stars as Rose, a young rich lady who travels on the Titanic, the boat which is destined to change human kind for ever as it sets sail in 1912. The story is told from an older Rose's point of view as she experiences life on the ""unsinkable ship"". Meeting Jack Dawson (Leo Di Caprio ¬ñ Gangs of New York) this charming romantic tale brings out a heart-warming story of young love with an unmissable ending.Winner of 11 Oscars, David Cameron's Titanic is a wonderful tale of two young people who meet and begin to learn about life in different ways from one another. Winslet and Di Caprio are perfect as the two characters. From the wealthy and stubborn Rose to the relaxed and positive Jack, audiences can appreciate each character's different backgrounds and engage more into their lives. The characters are well developed in this film, giving the film more depth. Di Caprio and Winslet have good on screen chemistry making the film engaging and light hearted.Many critics have argued its predictability and its clich√©s but with a film like this, you have to look past them to the depth and control of the power of the characters and the surroundings in which they find themselves.The ending for me was really powerful and difficult to watch, I was close to tears.

I still, after all of my time on this earth, find it hard to believe that people can be brainwashed SO much by media hype.I'm not about to say the movie was *bad*. I would probably use the word *contrived*. This movie contains just about everything that a rational human being should be repulsed by:-> a cheesy soundtrack that lingers *to this day* on radio stations everywhere.-> a mass of Titanic zombies who keep talking and talking and talking about the movie.-> an embellished and trite ""historical"" plot based on ""real"" events.There is absolutely no way that this movie should have taken up 3 hours of your time, save the fact that it was so expensive they probably didn't want to waste one inch of film.  I guess they figured since you already know the ending, they'd string you along with overdone, poorboy-richgirl cliches and special effects.  Yeah, the effects *were* great (I certainly couldn't do them); I'm just praying for the day when it's finlly passe to even talk about special effects.Consider that DreamWorks, the company stemming from the little project know as the Star Wars Trilogy, had to invent special effects, invent the tools to invent the special effects, and had virtually no prior model to base any of their work (or at least techniques) on.  Today it's all old hat; who can write programs that render graphics quickly; who is the resident software expert; who can do the most in the least amount of time. I guess once we get sick of 100% computer-graphic-generated movies, we'll stop all this nonsense already.",No Rating

Does not hold up well twelve years later,Herbest8,5 October 2009,"This is, without question, one of the most overblown movies of the last twenty years. This is a romantic retelling of the infamous sinking and who do we have as stars? Two pretty people (Leo and Kate) who will never be compared to Clark and Vivian but nobody's perfect.This is a real hit and miss film. The cons are just huge: the framing story is completely unnecessary, the story is so stilted, and the whole set-up prior to the climax is just boring. Not really helping matters is that the love story seems recycled from a Lifetime TV movie.The pros are minor but save it from complete disaster. The ship sinking climax is very well done and loaded with tension, some of the cast members do very well (a good example being Victor Garber as the kindly Thomas Andrews) but I think special mention should go to David Warner as the cruel valet, Spicer Lovejoy. Warner steals every scene he's in and his death scene at the ship splitting is simply priceless.Although it doesn't hold up particularly well and is certainly no masterpiece, it's OK overall.",3/10

Annoyingly Overrated,ChaseMc,2 March 1999,"The acting was rather mediocre, the love story was no different than any other love story, and the movie has one hour too long.

"Why it is still hated by some critics, I will never know",RichardKleiner,5 January 2008,"This is probably the best example of a critic's grudge against a terrific film. Yes, the love story is clich√©d and unoriginal. So what? Everything else is flawless. The effort James Cameron spent with the historical accuracy is commendable at least. Not so many times we can see a film set in a certain time period with appropriate costumes, set designs, silverware, etc. Even the actors were cast to be almost identical to their real life counterparts. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the dialog bad at all. There are no lines passing for catch phrases, like in other big budget movies. The visual effects, I'm speechless just to think about them. Even the love story, cheesy as it is, was greatly written, like in the old days. The acting was great, almost obliged to be great. The characters were amazingly portrayed, and Cameron made sure every single death would ache your heart (except for Lovejoy), something nobody really can do nowadays. Of course, there is the nude scene with Kate Winslet, something for all those pre-teens out there, and the little sex scene inside the coach. Aside of building up the romance between Rose and Jack, both scenes prove to be a little pointless. Even though, James Cameron is who actually draws the Rose picture, so that really gives more of an artistic merit. Music, well, it's good, and I don't mean just that song you all know. James Horner's score is actually very good, part of his list of great works.One critic spotted several technical errors in the movie, one of them being the sun's position during the ""I'm flying!"" sequence at the wrong side. But hey! If you want to find the bad stuff, you'll find it. That's not what film-making is about. You don't go to the theater to shred to pieces any single movie you see (we got MST3K for that). Titanic is one of those few movies that is timeless to this day. I can only compare it to Casablanca, or more specially to Gone With the Wind. It's larger than life, it's long as hell, but it's enjoyable every single time you see it (I forgot how many times I've seen it on TV alone).",9/10
Massive in scale but little in actual substance,TheNabOwnzz,13 July 2018,"It is quite easy to be swept away by Titanic's outstanding cinematography or exceptional musical score, and as a result a lot of its obvious flaws and faults seem to be overlooked. As an objective viewer however it is quite obviously an unfortunate disappointment.As stated before the cinematography in Titanic is fantastic, with a lot of widescreen shots of the ship from high angles. A couple of scenes such as the attempted Rose suicide near its start or when the final part of the ship goes down do look pretty bad and fake though, but for most of the film it looks pretty beautiful. The indoor set design is also amazing, and it basically breathes 1912 to look at its elegant and artistic design. The musical score by James Horner is also ( as to be expected from him ) a beautiful emotional piece that seems to fit extremely well in Titanic. However, while it is a very stylish film this way, it doesn't manage to be impressive on the actual substantial aspects of cinema, such as its acting or its screenplay, which are both very inconsistent to say the least. Billy Zane, Kathy Bates & Bernard Hill are some examples of actors/actress who do show a impressive performance, but Kate Winslet as young Rose has this monotone emotionless look on her face all the time, and i find it hard to see what Jack ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) sees in her because of this. Winslet is not capable of acquiring the emotional intensity that is required for a role such as this, since her acting is so theatrical and not very natural. While DiCaprio is a fantastic actor, he seems to be struggling in every scene in Titanic, primarily because he is simply miscast. He is not the type of actor for a supposed heart tugging romance, and he is thus unable to truly capture the essence of their bond. ( For an actually GOOD young DiCaprio role, watch the Basketball Diaries (1995) )Unfortunately James Cameron not only wanted to direct, but also write a film as grand in scale as this one. This results in a pretty mediocre screenplay and dialogue that a kid could have come up with. Titanic offers little sub text, symbolism or depth since its writing is sub par to say the least. There are a lot of corny moments and clich√© dialogue ( The entire scene of Rose discovering Jack's talent for drawings for example ) and all the while it has very little subtlety and it is unable to tell the audience something without blatantly having some character saying it, which in itself is ofcourse an insult to the audience's intelligence, and it results in Titanic being quite a poorly written movie that is not intelligent and most of the time just plain dumb.The first part of the film seems more like a social commentary instead of a film, as Cameron tries his best to show the audience what a bunch of snobbish unlikeable & arrogant folk the rich people are, and how outgoing and free the poor people seem to be. This might not have been so bad, if Cameron actually managed to be subtle in this matter, but this was not the case, as for example Billy Zane's character Cal is such an unsubtle way of telling the audience that the rich are bad. Ofcourse no offense to Billy Zane, who was great as his character, but his entire character is utterly ridiculous and he is unable to perform a single likeable action throughout the entire film, and this never changes. We get it Cameron, the rich guy is the bad guy, no need to shove it down our throats. Cameron's greatest mistake seems to be the decision to write the movie himself instead of bringing in an experienced screenplay writer.The second half of the film is more of a disaster movie, and it isn't so different from your average modern day monster blockbuster, except the monster in this film is the water. Even if there were any hidden meaning behind the first half of Titanic, the second half contains no depth whatsoever, and shows us the demise of a lot of characters nobody knows and nobody cares about. In the end we don't really care that much about Rose and Jack either, since their acting was not up to the challenge and the dialogue provided by Cameron was not fantastic either. It also shows us multiple instances of weird moments of self sacrifice, with people sacrificing themselves for no obvious reason instead of trying to escape. While this might be realistic in a film about the Japanese bushido code, in Titanic it feels out of character and it just doesn't fit, since these are all normal people who should want to simply get on with their lives.Cameron might show some images to impress the audience with his take on this real life tragedy, ( The opening scene with the old footage of Titanic actually setting off with Horner's score is ofcourse fantastic ) but in substance Titanic is severely flawed and the experience of watching it is therefore less immersive which in turn makes it lack the emotional impact it should have had.",5/10
Terrible and Overblown,filmboy-4,15 April 1999,"Best film ever, most certainly not. Best film of 1997, again not in with a chance. I have to report that while watching ""Titanic"" I found myself being totally bored by the stereotypical charecters, i.e Snobbish English, Battleaxe American. Cameron has also reeled out loads of cliches and made them 10 times more boring. There is also an undertone of class struggle which is direly executed. As for ""Titanic"" being called a love story, that could never be said as there was no chemistry between the two leads and to me no feelings of love came across (James try watching other Oscar nominee As Good As It Gets for a decent love story). As for the tragedy that was Titanic in the film I did not feel as though the tragedy was fully put across and I left actually feeling numb from this glamourised dross. How this truly terrible film managed to get the Best Film Oscar is beyond me (As Good As It Gets a much better and beautiful film) and how Cameron got the Best Director award is unbelievable although is unsurprising when people like Martin Scorsese do not get an Oscar for films such as Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Mean Streets.",2/10
"Too much Kate and Leo, too little Titanic",Prichards12345,15 April 2012,"I know in advance this review is not going to be popular; but it is my honest opinion for what it's worth. This is not a review of the 3-D version.The final hour of this movie is incredibly captivating; the effects are astonishing, the human drama endlessly gripping and the horror of the terrible tragedy deeply moving and powerful. Direction by James Cameron is impeccable, he thoroughly deserved his Oscar; the film looks wonderful and the music score is marvellous.But is it really such a classic? I think not, personally. A Night To Remember may have dated effects-wise but it tells the story of The Titanic in a superior way to this movie. The big problem for me is the script; which for the most part I think is quite poor. Cameron lifts whole segments from A Night To Remember, inserts dialogue from the testimonies given during the enquiry into the cause of the disaster, and alters history in a way that must have been quite shocking to the descendants of those involved. Officer Murdoch, for instance. He did not shoot two passengers; nor is it very likely he committed suicide. Murdoch's decision to reverse the engines when the iceberg was spotted probably caused the disaster - Titantic would have missed it had the full ahead order been given; even a nose-on impact would not have sunk the ship. But there is no evidence whatsoever Murdoch, who distinguished himself in the aftermath of the accident, committed suicide. Just a few passenger rumours that one of the officers shot himself.Kate and Leo. Nice acting from Kate, DiCaprio is simply too young for the man of the world artist. He has matured into a very fine actor, but the ""romance"" never convinces me for an instant. Far too much time is spent on it; with the result that the story of the Titanic is sort of shoe-horned into the movie in a series of brief sequences. The whole question of The Californian is omitted to give Kate and Leo more screen time, and The Carpathia barely appears. Lightoller's remarkable escape is hardly referenced: and here the brave but slightly misguided officer comes across as panicky and arrogant. Very unfair indeed.The result is rather fake emotionalism and moonshine, rather like Avatar, in fact, although admittedly Titanic is a better movie.Some of the acting in this movie is also very poor. Billy Zane is quite awful as Cal. He gives a performance that would do Dick Dastardly proud. All he really needed was a few moustache twirls and evil titters. One-dimensional character; one dimensional acting. Excellent actors like Kathy Bates, Bernard Hill and David Warner are wasted in this movie.The film has much to commend it but my honest assessment is that it also has a lot of flaws. Time for you to mark me down! :)",7/10
If the ship didn't sink......,evilnail,11 December 2000,"Titanic has made movie history!! It's unbelievable that such a bad tearjerker can be doing so well at the box office!!Where is the plot? Well, the movie does have ... sort of a plot, but it's very very very weak. The love between Jack and Rose is so superficial.Where are the characters? I can't find any real character! Everywhere I look, I find cliches and stereotypes. The rich must be arrogant, ignorant, evil, etc, while the poor must be the exact opposite.Can the actors act? Sure, every single one can but not in this movie. The acting is somewhere between so-so and bad! I've seen better performance from Cathy Bates, Leonardo DiCarpio, Bill Paxton.. in other movies.The visual effects is the only saving grace! The sinking of the ship is just magnificent!! It's just a shame they could have spent so much money to recreate the ship but they couldn't create a good story that has characters with substance!For teenagers who are flooded with hormones and a not-so-well-developed brain, it's understandable that they love the movie.

"A True Classic Belonging at the Top of the ""Epic"" Genre",Zac_La_Porte,13 September 2021,"The film masters in fictionalising a firm love tale and gently pressing it in between a beautifully intense reenactment of the Titanic's disastrous tragedy. Although it's not what you'd class as a romantic thriller, it's incredibly romantic and very thrilling; audiences will specifically admire just the romance, the thrills, or both! And within a runtime of 3 hours, James Cameron portrays the fluently-designed story in a way that never gets boring, constantly moves swiftly, and remains a true classic.The first half of the movie portrays a fictional but a very solid and tragic love story. Most romance movies that end in tragedy are ones where one of the lead lovers die. Whether Titanic involves that or not, it's never as sappy or average as other films that do that. The depiction of the relationship between memorable characters, Jack and Rose, is acceptable. But their story would never be as great if it weren't all taken and set on ship that leads to sinking.What's most memorable about the film, and what makes it such a classic epic, is the second half of the film. Titanic focuses on romance, but steers the ship to hit the iceberg and begin sinking. It's thankfully not just a 10 minute sequence, but devotes the entire sinking of the ship to the second half of the movie. The portrayal of the Titanic beginning to forward to the bottom of the ocean, snapping into two, and sticking right up before heading straight down is astonishingly-crafted. It's all gorgeous, intense, epic and depressing.Although the storytelling comes from Rose, the actual tale is equally viewed through the eyes of both Leonardo DiCaprio's young Jack and Kate Winslet's young Rose. Thankfully, it's not targeted at only one's issues. Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go on"" makes the perfect theme, the cast's performances make the perfect characters, and the whole movie should be left as the classic storyteller of Titanic.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",8/10
A Terrific Film!,moviewizguy,17 February 2007,"This film is about Rose DeWitt Bukater, a rich girl, and Jack Dawson, a poor boy who both fall in love on the ship, Titanic, in which it sank in 1912.This is a very wonderful film with great romance and peril. The special effects are terrific in the film. It's top notch with the action scenes and keeps the suspense going on the film. Well, that's the second half of the film.The first half is a great romance. We see Rose when she old (obviously, she survived) and she's telling the tale to ones who want to seek treasure in the ship. They don't believe her but as she tells the story, they do.I wasn't some of the millions who have seen this movie in the theater because I was practically five and there was no way that I would recognize this film. Now that I've finally seen the whole film, I've always seen the ending but never the whole movie, I loved it. I thought the first hour was going to be a waste because I don't imagine a film going 3 hours long unless the sinking occurs in the end but it occurred in the second half of the film.The acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are great. they have great chemistry in the film and others like Billy Zane and Kathy Bates are good too.This is one of the best films ever.

almost like a time travel movie,bainslie,10 February 2002,"This movie,""Titanic"", has great moments in it such as the dramatic sinking of the ship with all the intense desperation that event brought about in the crew and passengers as they struggled to live. There is no denying that movie has appealed to audiences around the world. Titanic fever has once again hit young and old and I'm sure books produced about this tragedy would have sold well. My frustration with the movie was not the special effects which were brilliant but rather the way in which the two main characters, Jack and Rose, acted in the movie. It was almost as if the two characters had hopped into a time machine and magically appeared on the deck of the Titanic behaving just as they would have done in our era. Who really would have tolerated the activities of Jack and Rose as they moved about the ship in such a free and easy way? The strict manners of 1912 were not the easy manners of our era. I for one did not shed a tear when Jack went under the water in 1912 as I would have done if he had drowned today (because today he would have been at least a real person of our time). The Jack in this movie is so out of place and time (and Rose is too liberated in her behaviour for that era - really the love scene in the car is a laugh a minute). The real heroes of the Titanic were the crew who sacrificed their lives for the safety of the passengers, the poorer passengers who lost their lives because of the preference given to the rich in allotting spaces on the lifeboats and those men who bravely remained behind to let their wives and children get onto the few lifeboats available. Fictional characters such as Jack and Rose simply created to appeal to a late 20th century audience do these real heroes of 1912 a great disservice. ""Titanic"" is a movie to see because of its special effects but it is hardly memorable in its presentation of its lead characters.",4/10
Very well done movie,MadMark96,5 October 2021,"Anyone else remember watching this years ago when it was so long it took up two VHS tapes? Yeah this movie has a special place for me. I always loved learning about the titanic as a kid and I'll never forget when my aunt gave me this movie and I watched it. Obviously a lot went over my head as a kid and rewatching it as an adult it has a lot of really funny scenes if I'm being totally honest. Like the fact Rose did marry after Jack and just never told anyone her ""last name"" is actually her dead ex boyfriends name and she has kids even grandkids with this new dude but when she dies she's with Jack and not the guy she had a family with is really funny. I mean just imagine being her husband and waiting for her to join you in the after life only to find out she was hoeing it up on the titanic again with her ex haha.

The Most Loathed Film Of All-Time,MovieAddict2016,10 July 2006,"I gave this film a bad review on IMDb in 2002. I deleted my review today - mainly because I don't agree with it anymore. In fact, I'm not so sure I totally agreed with it when I wrote it. I felt an obligation to hate this movie because people who like it are typically made fun of. But I have to admit: I _do_ like it. Yes, the romantic subplot is silly to the extent that Jack would never find himself anywhere near Rose to begin with. But you know what? The romance provides a nice outlet through which to frame the actions of the Titanic's sinking. A three-hour movie about random people on a boat that's going to sink would be a true bore. James Cameron - despite his personal flaws - is a great storyteller and by focusing on characters before heading on to the carnage, he builds a relationship with the viewer. Think of any good historical movie - apart from a few films such as ""The Longest Day,"" most of the time there's a story taking place around the event.As for ""Titanic"" - some people will feel offended. Some people will hate the romantic subplot and find the entire thing unbearably hokey. Some people will make fun of Leonardo DiCaprio (although, thankfully, that phase seems to have passed and he now demands more respect as an actor). And some people will just fast-forward to the end so they can see the Titanic sink (and I'm really hoping that wasn't a spoiler for anyone - because if it was, you need to go take a middle school history course again).The acting isn't bad. Leonardo DiCaprio picked up a lot of misery for his acting here. But he's gone on since to prove, like Johnny Depp, that he's more than just a pretty face. His performances in films such as ""The Aviator"" and ""Catch Me If You Can"" echo his early work in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" - he's one of this generation's finest actors. It's no wonder Scorsese enjoys working with him so much. It may almost seem absurd to even make this comparison, but after some of his recent films DiCaprio has struck me as another Robert De Niro: he has the talent and the intelligence. It's a shame the success of ""Titanic"" pushed him back for a few years.Kate Winslet, on the other hand, is a nice contrast against DiCaprio, however I didn't totally buy their romance at all times and they're not the best screen couple in cinema history by any means. Meanwhile, in the Villain Department, Billy Zane is, for once, not bald.If you don't think you'll like it, you probably won't. It's one of those films that people either love or hate. If you didn't like ""Braveheart"" there's a good chance you'll hate this as well.If you can watch it with an open mind, however, and accept its romantic angle, you may enjoy it.",8/10

"It's actually a very good film, amazingly underrated on IMDb",TheUnknown837-1,15 January 2007,"James Cameron, the director who brought us horror classics such as ""The Terminator"" and ""Aliens"" suddenly swings around and gives us what is definitely his greatest achievement yet, in a movie that is still quite violent, yet about the exact opposite of his previous films. A love story about two young people from essentially opposite sides of life meeting on board the ill-fated ship RMS Titanic.Our cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio, who launched his career with this film. Academy Award nominee Kate Winslet, along with Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, David Warner, Billy Zane, and numerous others star in this expansive film that covers nearly every historical detail that is not part of the fictional love story. DiCaprio did very fine in his role, along with Winslet. Gloria Stuart was also very good in her role, though it was a small one.Like all love stories, the film includes romantic scenes which are in my opinion, some of the best produced in film history. We become emotionally attached to the two main characters as they struggle to hold onto each other through the huge disaster the Titanic makes its destructive collision against the iceberg.""Titanic"" made several achievements when it was released. It grossed over a billion dollars and is the highest grossing motion picture worldwide of all time. It also won eleven Academy Awards, one of only three films to do so. It launched the career of Leonard DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. And it is a very good love story. Unfortunately, it is also a movie that a large portion of the crowd hates.

In the typical James Cameron style, this film is just crawling with stuff you wouldn't believe.  The movie starts out dull, with Gloria Stuart helping to pad out the first ten minutes, but then it really gets rolling!  Afterwards, I had to ask myself: Hey, got a cigarette?  I felt spent, and that's typical of Cameron movies too.  If Cameron made a biblical film, I bet he'd have a twenty minute crucifixion scene.  The sinking was incredible, and they saved the best for last; the rest is just another day on board a Loveboat style rip-off.  Oh well, Cameron's not much without his special effects here, but that's what everyone who goes to see this movie already knows.  James Cameron should stop giving himself Orson Welles injections, and just stick to making action movies.  I just keep thinking of those slick effects in his other films, and how beautiful they all were.  This movie?  I guess James was just trying to display some emotion, but it was corny.

Leo and Kate have the perfect chemistry and the soundtrack is beautiful. I think it's captured what really happened in history incredibly well and you really felt that you were with them in the ship. The videography is very skilled and the storyline is very different to other love stories. If you want a romantic, historical, thrilling period drama film then this is it. Don't be put off that it is 3 hours because it isn't slow at all. It keeps pace and the acting is very very good. I really recommend watching it.",10/10
Incredible,ckinnair205,12 October 2012,"Titanic is exceptional. This is what a real film is all about. The love story topped the icing on the cake for me, It's increasingly sad and all the while you still know what's the come. It's a real treat to be able to watch, the theme of the film is self explanatory; however there is so much to it. Regardless whether the love story is true or not, it doesn't matter because without this it would not be as emotionally galvanising as it is. It's astounding. It's obvious that Jack dies at the end and Rose is very upset. It's a brilliant film, def a classic! Highly recommended to anyone looking for something to weep at for days! Enjoy.",10/10
"The Titanic is totally missed in ""Titanic""",donkeylipz,17 March 2010,"For all of this film's popularity, I blame the public most. Along with Avatar, Titanic shows me that audiences are less clever than they should be and fall for superficial drivel. The biggest problem about Titanic is that it isn't about Titanic at all. We could just as easily called this ""sinking ship"" or it could just as easily have taken place on the Lusitania, and the story would still have ignored the tragedy whether it was an iceberg or a U-Boat that sank the ship.What is most disappointing is the film could have been a wonderful set piece and could have produced compelling drama. For instance, Molly Brown was actually a real leader on the life boats and took care of the sick and injured on the Carpathia, and mail room workers sacrificed their lives to try and save the mail for people back in the States. Granted, these are but a few instances of bravery, and a film needs central characters for a plot, but the story decided to focus on something petty and unrealistic in the face of true drama.The problem with the romance is this: it's contrived and it moves WAY too quickly. First, there is the issue that Jack totally takes advantage of Rose. She was about to jump off the Titanic. She clearly has some depression issues, and he thinks it's a good time to woo her? And Rose herself is a contradictory character. She seems to hate the life of a rich woman without independence, but she also looks down at Jack's social status as not being sophisticated enough. Besides, if she hated Cal that much she could just leave. Perhaps you say that Jack had to be the catalyst to that decision. That's fine, but remember that giving advice is one thing, swooping in and starting a tryst is another.And about Jack and Rose's relationship itself, just how prevalent could it have been, even in the 1990's, for a couple to engage in intercourse after knowing each other just two nights? Yes, it happens but not on average, especially between two people from totally different worlds like Jack and Rose and in the 1910's! And just where does anyone think the relationship would have gone after Titanic docked? Does Rose expect Jack, clearly a drifter, to provide for a family? For all of her desire to be independent and taken seriously, I don't think Rose wants to be destitute. I can understand the events if the two grew up together, but relationships that move this fast tend to be based on impulse, not love, and so they end up failing, yet as an audience, we are expected to believe that true love blossomed and died on screen. I felt like I was watching an episode of 90210. I'm sorry, but that is the definition of contrived. I am not saying scrap a love story period, but this ""relationship"" became a smokescreen for dividing classes. The movie goes out of its way to say that Jack is Jack because he is poor, and it can't work with Rose if he is rich.I know it may not be fair to bring up Avatar, but it does expose some of Titanic's characterization flaws. Our ""villains"" Cal Hockley and Rose's mother, much like the military and the corporation in Avatar are totally evil and Rose and Jack and the Na'Vi are totally good. The first class passengers are totally obnoxious. The third class is totally noble and blameless. So caricatures of people or groups of them constitute good writing? Granted, the struggle for third class to get to the deck for lifeboats was actually somewhat compelling, but it doesn't change the fact that everyone is portrayed at an extreme. The fact that people heralded the film is a sign that the audience accepted those caricatures and extreme portrayals as accurate.I will give the film some merit though. The design of Titanic has stood the test of time. After twelve years and change, it's still a beautiful set to see. Costumes, lighting and the ship itself are appealing and put the viewer directly in the setting. It's really a shame that style over substance has become Cameron's focus. His previous films actually had character studies. Aliens was a piece on Ripley's development and a Vietnam parallel. Can Titanic boast such a comparison? No. Still, it looked as good as the rest of his films.Titanic, for all its popularity, boils down to a superficial 1990's teen drama that targeted girls aged 15-18. That it decided to manifest itself during a tragic calamity is an insult. Why so many people older than 18 couldn't see Titanic for what it really was, is the bigger insult. Perhaps it reminded many of spontaneity long gone and that they wanted it again. Good Burger reminds me that I want a juicy sandwich from ""In and Out"" but that doesn't mean Good Burger was a good film.",3/10
A legendary film,byrann_gowan,11 July 2012,"This film is one of only a select few that has had the privilege of winning 11 Academy Awards, and with good reason. It is clearly one of the best films of all time. I got the privilege of seeing it earlier this year in 3D. I had already seen it before, but my parents said that it was quite the experience seeing it in theatres. They could not be more correct on that.The story is that Rose, an upper-class citizen, is engaged to a wealthy man named Cal. However, she feels trapped in her world, and she is almost pushed over the ledge when she meets Jack, a lower-class citizen. Despite their difference in social status, they take a liking to each other, despite Cal's and her mother's hatred of Jack. Despite their social status and everybody against their pairing, the two fall deeply in love, when suddenly... well, if you know the story of the RMS Titanic, then you know the rest of this story.James Cameron, you are a master filmmaker. You've done it with the Terminator movies, Aliens, True Lies, The Abyss, and you have also done it with Titanic, as well as Avatar, which is my favourite movie of all time. What Cameron is great at doing is creating a story in which the first part tells the story without all the crazy stuff happening, so that when the second part/final action scenes come, we know who to cheer for when something good happens and who to cry for when something bad happens. He did it with this movie, he did it with Avatar; it is a great way of providing the audience with amazing special effects and action sequences without them being too distracting from the movie.I must also applaud the acting. Gloria Stuart is amazing in her supporting role, and she shares much of her screen time with Bill Paxton, who also does great, despite the limitations he gets in this film. Frances Fisher is great as the overbearing mother, who seems to only care about money, and not about her daughters' wishes. Kathy Bates lightens up the screen with her witty dialogue as Molly Brown, while Billy Zane is great as the antagonist, Cal.However, it is our two leads, Leo and Kate, who truly shine here. They would later go on to act in Revolutionary Road, and both films show their chemistry well. If these two became a real-life couple, I would not be surprised, as they seem to have a whole lot of chemistry on screen.Overall, this movie is a triumph. If you have not seen it, stop reading this, turn off your computer, go to the nearest DVD store, and buy it. The dialogue might be a little cheesy for you to handle, but the actors are great, the story is great, the direction is great, etc. Overall, a 10/10 for me.",8/10
"Terrible, overrated, tired",Pas2leo53,12 April 2005,"This movie began the sad trend of turning tragedies into love stories. After Titanic came Pearl Harbor. It really is getting sad. The only good part of this movie is the sinking of the ship. The CG in that part is really good, but really, was this that great of a movie? No. To prove this, one must only look at its theme song. Tired already? After hearing ""You'll be in my heart"" for the 1,496th time (yes, I really did count. I was really bored one month), i got really tired of it, to say the least. It is unbearably long, and undeservedly so. Unlike LOTR: ROTK, which was a truly epic movie, this movie just seemed to drag on. And what was with the dropping of the necklace into the ocean? Yes, it was symbolic, but really, that thing was worth millions!Anyways, if you are considering watching this movie, just forget it and go rent something meaningful, like the Godfather, or any of the LOTR movies, some truly GREAT movies. Or if you are looking for a laugh, get Thumbtanic. That was pretty funny, and it will basically give you a shorter, more intelligent overview of the Titanic than this movie did.",1/10
Tries to be all things to all people,audission,16 April 2005,"It's a love story. A blockbuster. An historical account. A thriller. An action-fest. It's art-house. It's popcorn. It's.. it's... all of these and none.Many others have gone over the historical inaccuracies in great detail so I will try and avoid mentioning them again, but as someone with a lifelong interest in the Titanic story Cameron's film is immensely frustrating. I have a lot of respect for James Cameron. He is a true master of spectacle, and although I've never met the guy I can imagine he is a grade-A control freak; whatever the criticisms of his films, you do not get to make a $200+ million dollar flick without being well and truly disciplined to your art. The detail is all there: the light fittings, crockery, engine room; the beautiful ship brought back to life in full colour, the bridge/bow/boat deck etc - a small army of crew working to build and light the set, costume designers and so on. The film should be recognized as a huge technical accomplishment for these reasons.Yet the film fails for one very simple reason: storyline.The appeal of the real Titanic story is multifold. It was never ""just a shipwreck"" - ships sink all the time, some larger than the Titanic, some with many more losses (the Lusitania is comparable, yet far less populist) - but the sinking marked the end of a period of human arrogance. No matter how technologically adept we become, fate can always intervene and scupper our best laid plans. No one thinks planes are ""uncrashable"" or that we can somehow buy immunity from a grisly fate. And since the real people on board the Titanic represented every walk of society, from billionaires to those starting a new life, the fact that rich and poor perished together on this brand new ship altered our thinking. When the story starts there are four classes of people: First class, second class, third class ('steerage') and crew. By the end, there are two: living and dead.If the real story was fictional, it could not be dreamt up better. There are so many iconic moments to savour they would barely fit into a 3 hours film: Passengers requesting bits of the 'berg to put in their drinks, the Californian's wireless operator going to sleep, the growing realisation that something is seriously wrong etc -the list is endless. So if it is one of the most enduring stories of human behaviour and ""nature vs man"", why do we need Cameron's wafer-thin plot? As a Titanic buff I watch the special effects with delight. The ship is back from the deep, no question. But I find myself willing Jack and Rose to get out of the way. There are some many fascinating 'real' characters that we never get to more than acknowledge. What makes THEM tick? I get the feeling Cameron is fascinated too, but restrained by the demands of a teenage popcorn audience, who've failed to imagine that a poor boy falling in love with a super-rich girl and sacrificing himself in 24 hours is complete ""poppycock"" (1912) - or in Cameron-speak, ""a bunch of horses**t"" (1997).(Incidentally, if I was a first class passenger on the Titanic, I would feel slightly aggrieved I'd paid so much, since in Cameron's version it seems all passengers are free to wander anywhere they like. Except when it starts sinking of course, then suddenly it's impossible to get above decks.) Head for your nearest iMax cinema and watch ""Ghosts of the Abyss"" - Cameron's slightly cheesy but good documentary featuring much more of the underwater scenes from the film. Or for a more accurate retelling of the story try 1958's A Night To Remember. If you want a love story, go for Romeo and Juliet. For a ""people out of their time"" film, try Les Visiteurs or Bill and Ted.In short, TITANIC tries to be all of these things, and excels at none of them.",3/10

good retelling of great tragedy,mukava991,2 August 2008,"James Cameron's Titanic holds up very well indeed after more than ten years since initial release. The minuses now are the same as then but they are minor in comparison to the plusses. First of all, the Titanic is one of the grandest tragedies of human history. The highest and mightiest could tumble. It was an analogy to the state of the world, almost like a foreshadowing of the First World War when all that seemed eternal disintegrated with spectacular suddenness.Cameron approaches the task primarily as a hardware technician. The ship looks the way it has to look - grandiose, solid, lavishly appointed. The physical details are spot on, down to the last piece of china. This all helps. The use of CGI during the prolonged sinking is largely state of the art even now.The idea of putting a story of young lovers at the center of the film is a sound, if trite, way to give us the universal through the particular. The film would have been just as gripping if Cameron had chosen a more Altmanesque approach whereby a whole group of characters would be given more or less equal weight as they made their way to journey's end. Here the focus is on the teenage couple: unhappy rich girl (Kate Winslet) and working-class bohemian artiste (Leonardo DiCaprio). The problem with these usually fine actors is that too often their youthful brio seems forced, as if Cameron as director/screenwriter is straining to point out their youth, their vitality, their exuberance, in contrast to Winslet's stuffy social set which disapproves of their alliance. The best acting comes from Billy Zane as the arrogant, sadistic, petulant fianc√© of Winslet who stops at nothing to separate her from unwashed upstart DiCaprio. Zane gets it all right, including the clipped prep school accent which barely conceals his primal, frustrated rage at being trumped by someone from the lower classes. DiCaprio comes across as a modern suburban high school student playing a street urchin in a drama class presentation. There is no real edge to him. In fact, if the casting had been reversed it would have made much more sense. But DiCaprio's youth, looks and agility carry him through the spectacle. Besides, we don't go to spectacles for acting nuance.Cameron's script isn't as dreadful as some claim, but it has significant shortcomings. (Screenwriting was the only major category in which Titanic was not nominated for an Oscar - and for good reason.) A bit of working over by a competent script doctor would have made it truer. Amazingly, considering Cameron himself has some background in visual arts, the situations and dialogue touching on questions of painting are embarrassingly unimaginative and superficial. And much of the banter between Winslet and DiCaprio sounds late 20th century, not 1912. The conflict between the haughty first-class passengers and those beneath them is perhaps overdone. Frances Fisher is touching as Winslet's socially striving mother for whom we feel both pity and contempt as she pushes her daughter into marriage with a soulless brute. Gloria Stuart as Kate Winslet grown old and Victor Garber as the ship's designer who sees his master creation ripped asunder also stand out. And some of the dinner table conversation in the first-class dining room is elegant and witty.One implausibility: The water temperature of the sea in which the Titanic sank was just above freezing. No human, save an Olympic athlete, or at least the young and vigorous, could have survived more than a few minutes in waters of that temperature. Survivors relate that the screaming of the passengers who landed in the water when the ship sank subsided after only a few minutes. None could survive the water. Yet Kate Winslet is seen wading neck deep in this ice bath for minutes on end as she struggles to rescue DiCaprio who has been handcuffed to steam pipes in a lower-level cabin. Then the two proceed through endless corridors of freezing water to the deck where they continue on, fighting their way through panicked crowds, breaking down barriers, leaping and scaling heights, etc. until they finally go down with the ship into the freezing sea where they survive for endless minutes more as they as they cling to debris.A CGI flaw: Just as false, occasionally Cameron's keyboard tappers and mouse movers add little puffs of computer-generated condensed breath to accompany the exhalations of actors in close up. Problem is, only intermittently does this condensation appear. One moment you see it, another moment it's gone.The interminable lovey-dovey blatherings between Winslet and DiCaprio as they float in the ice water quickly wear thin. Perhaps pre-teen girls (a major component of this film's box office) would be transfixed by this interlude, but surely most adults would be yearning for DiCaprio's character to die and get it over with.And even more dreadful than everything cited above is the treacly ""Our Love Will Go On,"" a pop song belted by Celine Dion over the closing credits. I am sick and tired of contemporary pop songs being tacked on to historical dramas.Finally, the ultimate film to see on this subject is ""Titanic: The Legend Lives On"" (1994), a fascinating and moving 4-hour-plus Arts & Entertainment Channel documentary about the Titanic from conception through construction through destruction, aftermath and cultural/historical legacy. More emotionally involving and fascinating than Cameron's movie. It will stay with you for a long time.",8/10
James Cameron has lost it big time,demondrink,27 August 2002,"A tragic story. And not in the sense that it made me cry. This film is pathetic. The love story is tedious, the depiction of Irish peasantry panders to the crassest stereotypes and Celine Dion's stinky theme song is just the icing an a horrible anti-cake. Somewhere along the line, around about Terminator 2 and True Lies, director James Cameron went badly astray. He became so obsessed with setting new Special Effects standards that he lost sight of characters, dramatic plausibility and any measure of emotional honesty, which are all far more essential to a film's credibility. The characters in this film are bland and uninspiring. To call them one-dimensional would be an insult to Geometry.It's ironic that a film which cost so much to make in terms of special effects should go for the cheapest possible emotional return - Billy Zane is his usual camp, pantomime-villain self, Leonardo DiCaprio is as wet as the sea he eventually (thankfully) drowns in and even the usually reliable David Warner is flat and listless. This film gets three out of ten. And all those points are for the last hour when the ship sinks - the only good part of the film. The rest of it should be consigned to the bottom of the Atlantic and left there to rot.",3/10
"A tragic historical incident, dumbed down in order to empty pockets of the MTV generation in the name of popular culture.(Spoilers)",snoozejon,6 September 2004,"Once upon a time there was a director by the name of James. He brought us wonderfully, thrilling science-fiction such as Terminator and Aliens. These movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry. Terminator 2 showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new era........and then it happened...................1997........countless awards..........obscene amounts of money............outlandish barrage of advertising............maximum profit margin........Titanic was here!I have never (ever) been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it, in fact I have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going. Titanic however was a film I only took one single positive out of - that of Kate Winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughout!Quickly - the dialogue was like something out of Beverly Hills 90210, the acting was more wooden than my nephew's tree house, images meant to terrify were actually comical (man falling from ship and hitting propeller), historically false (don't even get me started because there's too much), it had dire theme music (up there with the bodyguard for cheese) and the pointless love story was so tedious, self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved (I was glad when he died and disappointed when she did not).It was plainly obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to MTV watching, bubblegum chewing, boy-with-car chasing, teenage girls (DeCaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band) who would drag their sex-starved boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chick-flick hoping to get lucky later! The worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point. Millions of dumbed down, culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because ""it cost so much to produce it must be great"" and ""Steve and Barbara said it was good and they know their movies"". The crowning glory arrived when Titanic swept the boards at the Academy Awards. King James of Hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based. It looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people. However, if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off. Good luck to Hollywood if that is how they want to make money, I'd do it if I had those kind of chances in life!It is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly, historically false/human interest tripe like ""The Patriot"" and ""Pearl Harbor"".",1/10

Titanic (1997) One of my favorite films.,Angelika_New_York,7 August 2022,"First time I saw it was on New Year's Eve 1997. It had only been out for 12 days at that point. Initially, I was reluctant only because I knew there would be underwater scenes, which I am afraid of, especially on a big movie theater screen. I saw it among a group of people at a Regal Cinemas. This is the first movie I have ever experienced in a stadium seating setting. Titanic is historic for many reasons. Honestly, I wasn't too familiar with the sinking of the Titanic. For me, experiencing this film at that time was, and will always be a game changer for cinema. I grew up watching cable TV, so I have seen many movies, but nothing could prepare me for what I was about to see in Titanic. It was one of the best experiences I've ever had in a movie theater, and although it was mostly packed, the people were into it. I'd say about the last hour and 25 minutes, I was in tears. The scene that did it for me was when Jack says to Rose, ""Why did you do that?! Why?!"" as they frantically embrace one another while next to the bottom of the staircase after she jumped back onto the ship. From there, I was a blubbering mess. Never seen anything like it. I was glad to see it in 3D when it was rereleased back in 2012. The 3D was so good, I briefly wondered why it hadn't been released that way in the first place, but it was already a gamble for the movie studios to begin with. Fortunately, it all paid off in the end, and then some.This movie really paved the way for the big-budgeted blockbusters that are out today. If it weren't for the success of Titanic, these movies that are out now would likely have been made eventually, but it probably would have taken a longer period of time. Also, movie studios were allowing more films to have longer running times. I tell you, this movie was trailblazing for what was to come in the industry.I must point out that I truly believe this is Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance. I know that he has an outstanding career. After all, he is one of the very few actors I can think of that's never been in a franchise. That's impressive to me. But I feel that this is his most nuanced performance. To me, it seems that he's been trying to live down Titanic ever since. He's always been a good actor, but it seems like he takes himself way too seriously. I don't expect, or wouldn't want, him to do romantic comedies, but in almost everything I've seen him in, he is brooding, or he freaks out in some way, therefore it doesn't always seem natural to me. Here, everything about his performance feels natural. I know that there were other actors considered for the role of Jack Dawson, but I can't imagine anyone other than DiCaprio playing the part. I think he should really be proud of this movie.As much as I love this movie, I think the biggest issue I have with it is how Billy Zane's character is too one-dimensional for me. I think it would have made things more interesting if his character was a nice guy, or had some significant qualities about him, but the decision is made too easy for Rose. I mean the guy is basically a jerk from the beginning to the end. Sure, I believe he loved Rose in his own way, but there just wasn't much depth to him. Also, it was absolutely unforgivable for him to strike Rose later on in the movie. The way he treated her was reprehensible.With that said, I don't believe this film has a black-and-white view of the lower-class people in contrast to the upper-class people. I think some of the characters on the upper decks are actually quite likable such as Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), and Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber) to name a few.Watching this film nowadays, I actually prefer the first hour and 37 minutes as opposed to the second hour and 37 minutes. I really was astonished by the sinking in the second half, but it really is sad watching all of those people die. Kind of as if I were watching people die in the World Trade Center. It's so tragic. The first half of the movie moves along pretty fast as the effective relationship develops between Jack and Rose, who, by the way, is so beautiful. Kate Winslet looks absolutely gorgeous and she is so much more than window dressing. I can't imagine anyone else in that role, either. The pacing of the entire thing is truly a wonder. There are movies that are nowhere near as long but can certainly feel that way.Overall, yes there are some flaws about it, usually when it comes to some of the dialogue, however, in this case, the pros far outweigh the cons. In the case of Titanic, the flaws are a part of its charms. It's like accepting someone's imperfections. After all, there is no such thing as a perfect movie, not even on IMDb's Top 250.I've thought about it and I just can't give it a rating less than a 10.",10/10
The new Romeo and Juliet,xxzerowildfirexx,2 February 2006,"Yeah, admitted, I love this movie. Which is nothing to be ashamed of; great movie, great directing, great set, great scale, great canvas, great story. Being a rookie filmmaker myself, I have many inspirations; but among my core favorites are Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Batman (Joel Schumacher aside), and Titanic. Its the quintessential love story, and I don't think there is any particular scene, or even a single shot, that lacks superb creative insight.Given that, I can't bring myself to name a scene that wasn't powerful. True each scene was more powerful than the one before it, but it didn't lessen the awe factor. Visual effects were done as they should be, done so well that its difficult to tell where the line is - digital/real.The score is phenomenal, James Horner provides a compelling score to finally go with a compelling movie. (I mean, lets face it, his work for Jumanji and Troy was good, but the movies lacked). For me, the musical score is one of the four key components to a good movie - good script, good acting, good directing, and good musical score. Thats just my personal analysis. True Celine Dion doesn't do the love theme justice, but the love theme is just the icing on the cake. the opening montages of the ship in all its grandeur made it truly feel like reality. Magnificent, beautiful, with some Irish humor! (admit it, you loved the Irish!!!) Whats not to like about this movie? It takes everything likable about Romeo and Juliet and gives it the backdrop of one of the greatest and most tragic moments in history. That, ladies and gentlemen, makes a timeless epic.",9/10
Oversold garbage,e-jane,26 December 1998,"Despite the millions it may have raked in, I'm sorry, this is one of the absolute worst movies I have ever seen.  Not that I don't think all the praise in the world for the technical side shouldn't be heaped upon it, the visual effects were undisputably stunning, but this is Hollywood at its worst : pure candyfloss.  Completely contrived, sugarcoated and poorly-written, Titanic is a waste of any thinking viewers' time.",1/10

How low the mighty have fallen!,Eightiesjunkie,14 May 2014,"To begin with, I liked James Cameron as a director. As a matter of fact, Aliens is my all-time favorite movie. Throughout the 80's and mid 90's James Cameron could do no wrong, then it happened: Christmas 1997 James Cameron released the most overrated, over-hyped piece of garbage that the world has ever known: Titanic! I don't buy for a second, that Cameron cared about the real tragedy, the victims, or the heroes! I firmly believe that Cameron's sole intention for making this movie was to fatten his wallet! Critics praised it as a masterpiece, Teen and preteen girls swooned, and before you knew it, this rancid, vomit inducing, cinematic travesty became the highest grossing movie of all time! Before I begin, let me just clarify one thing: I don't hate this movie because it was a hit, I hate this movie for much more than that! So the film begins with treasure hunters exploring the wreck of the Titanic. They're searching for something, but we don't know what that exactly is yet. They find an old safe, and decide to bring it up to the surface. They cheer, pop champagne bottles, and celebrate that they've found what they've been looking for. However, once the safe is opened, they only find an old drawing of a woman wearing a diamond necklace. Some time later, a local news station does a story on the treasure hunters' expedition. An old woman watching the news story recognizes the drawing, contacts the leader of the expedition, and they bring her to where they are. We find out that they are searching for that lost diamond necklace, and that she is the woman in the drawing. So the film then goes into her story, and to sum it all up, we get the same old clich√©-ridden love story, we've all seen before! Two people from two different worlds fall in love, and everything is working against their union. Some of you out there might be thinking that I hate this movie because I'm a guy, and generally, guys hate love stories. but that's not the case. I liked the movie Moulin Rouge, and I loved the movie The Notebook. The difference between those movies and this movie is: They actually did something NEW with that basic plot! Unlike Titanic, in which the only thing ""new"" is that that it happens on the Titanic. In the story, we meet characters that have the names of real people. These people include: Captain E.J. Smith, Designer Thomas Andrews, Builder Bruce Ismay, Crewman William Murdoch, and passengers, John Jacob Astor and ""The Unsinkable"" Molly Brown. Do we learn anything about these people or what happened to them? NO! These Characters are nothing more than plot devices! THIS, is the reason why I hate this movie! It is an insult to these people's family and memory to portray them this way! Specifically, William Murdoch's and Molly Brown's. In reality, these people were heroes! In this film however, Molly Brown is used as a comic relief, and William Murdoch, is made into a villain! James Cameron, How dare you!! In 2001, the movie Pearl Harbor was released, and everyone hated it. People have said that the movie was poorly written, the plot was horribly clich√©, and that it makes a cheap mockery of a real life tragedy. What people fail to realize is: This is exactly what Titanic was! Why is Pearl Harbor labeled as cinematic tripe and garbage, while a few years earlier, Titanic did the EXACT same thing and it's labeled a masterpiece! If you're going to hold Michael Bay's feet to the fire for Pearl Harbor, you might as well do the same to James Cameron. I know a lot of people still love this movie, and that's fine, to each their own. In my opinion however, there will never be enough hatred for this film, Even if everyone in the world turned around and suddenly hated it, it still wouldn't be enough!",1/10
underrated...,Indy-52,5 November 1999,"that is, by you IMDb voters. You seem to be the only people in the world to think this movie isn't great. This film is a masterpiece, which belongs in your top 250. It's the only 3 hour  movie that doesn't bore me. In fact, no one in the cinema seemed bored when i saw it. If you think that this movie is silly because of the dialogue, it's obvious you're all forgetting that this movie was made to entertain! It's the same thing with star wars: it's sort of a fable, and the dialogue is much cheesier than that of this film. It has great music, great special effects, great sound and fantastic cinematography. It was definitely the best picture of 1997, and Kate should have won the best actress award.",10/10
Magnificent film & a TITANIC experience in IMAX 3D,rhyderstudios,22 April 2023,"ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT!!!! A true cinematic masterpiece that is best experienced in IMAX 3D! Literally felt like I was there on the ship and was in awe of the scale of it on an IMAX screen. The depth and pop-out was the best post-converted 3D I've ever seen! Simply stunning and mesmerizing how real it all felt and that you could go up the staircase or down the hall, see the bow of the ship from afar and the titan of a ship it was from below. One of the most beautiful film's ever put to screen and as it has for 25 years and will continue to do so, it stands the test of time! I cried throughout the last hour and felt completely heartbroken by it all. Having seen the film once before when I was 11 during the 100th anniversary in April 2012 of the ship's sinking, I have always waited to watch it since but wanted to wait until I felt it was the right time. Thankfully, the wait was well worth it to experience the film in IMAX 3D with the 4K remaster! If you have the opportunity to see this film in this format in the future, definitely do so!",10/10
"Even better the second, third, and fourth times around.",TxMike,7 September 1999,"This is a May 2020 update, as I have watched this maybe 5 or 6 times over the years, most recently last night. Yes, it is long, and they probably spend too much time showing the carnage during the actual sinking, but after I start watching it and become immersed yet again the time figuratively flies.For a movie that was made almost 25 years ago it holds up extremely well in picture and sound. Dicaprio and Winslet are of course marvelous in their roles but for me Billy Zane is the best here, the way he plays the demanding rich American taking his British teenage fiancee back home, only to be interrupted by the carefree Jack who presents a completely different outlook on life.Say what you want about James Cameron, the person, but he did a masterful job of weaving together several different stories, including the elderly modern day Rose telling her story after Jack's charcoal drawing is recovered from the wreckage 2 1/2 miles under the surface of the Atlantic. Even just the modern day images of the real Titanic wreckage add immeasurably to the impact of the whole movie.This will remain a classic for many decades to come, well deserving of its various awards.",No Rating
"Transcending boundaries of race, class, and sex",Rich-197,14 August 1999,"Titanic is possibly the film of the decade - it manages to show that one thing transcends barriers between all the people of the world - ignorance. The incredible storytelling ability of Cameron, his audacity with special effects, and his casting prowess (who would have thought that by casting an ugly girl against a attractive guy, he would create the romance of the decade?) It's incredible hokum. What so many of the Anti-Titanic camp fail to realise is that bad acting, duff script, and glossy special effects don't necessarily mean a bad film (Star Wars as an example). The key point here is that Cameron's huge ability to target the world's biggest niche audience (the dumb middle class) is something that should be celebrated. He should be a role-model for all film makers out to make a financial success - exploitation is the key. I can sum this up in one sentence: The brains behind this picture deserve to have the $1.8billion success - the film itself doesn't",1/10

Titanic....my favorite movie of all time.,izzyymotleyy,22 June 2020,"I usually do not write reviews for movies, I'll rather just rate them. But this film is different. I NEED to talk about this film. I've loved this film ever since I was 6-7 years old, and I haven't stopped loving it since. Titanic is a masterpiece beyond levels. When it comes to the first half, were introduced to a romance/love story, which is just the heart of the movie. The film then needles through the past and present with breathtaking transitions. Then the second half of the film is basically a disaster movie, which some of the most heartbreaking moments introduced to film. Everything is so believable and so atmospheric. James Cameron is so talented as a director and as a writer when it comes to this film, his talent was very much noticed. This film is just....so masterful and so well made. Words can't express how much I adore this film, but it's just my favorite and I wish more movies were this well made in today's field.",10/10
"Lord, I hated this movie!",Julie-30,24 March 1999,"This movie has it all - horrible casting, lame dialogue, abysmal acting... What more could you ask for in an award-winning film? The awards I am thinking of, of course, are the Razzies.I wish!I started looking at my watch and squirming within 10 minutes. This film could not end soon enough for me.Besides the above, I was furious that Cameron also tried to revise history and make Rose into a 1990s woman.  A gently raised young lady in that time and that place would a)never have been the only person on board who knew that there were not enough life boats for all the passengers; b)never have heard of ""Mr. Picasso"" and ""Dr. Freud.""  In addition, 3rd class passengers would NEVER (I repeat, NEVER) have been allowed on a 1st class deck, and vice versa.  I also found it insulting that all the poor people were noble and all the rich people (except Rose of course) were evil.I kept thinking about Joe Queenan's comment: ""Sink the damned boat already!"" I never thought I'd find myself rooting for the iceberg.",No Rating
Best movie of all time,Eve6Kewl,13 August 1998,"I'm not a person who is greatly interested in romance stories.  I tend to go for action-packed flicks, horror stories, mysteries, or good suspense thrillers.  Comedies are also favorites.  Titanic, however, shed new light on romance stories.  The people in Titanic were portrayed so realistically, unlike other movies.  In Titanic, you could actually feel what was going on inside the people's minds and hearts.  The special effects were among the best I've seen.  I've only seen it four times to date, and it's definitely worth another four.",10/10

It is so very boring. I don't care for Gloria Stuart's character, although I think she plays her very well. I don't care about the old, boring people looking for the jewels, I just want to see the boat sink, just like everyone else. It is directed very badly, and how James Cameron won best director is a mystery to me, and many other people too. Kate Winslet did a lack-luster job, and that is hard for me to say, seeing as I adore her in everything else she is in. I think that it was a bad film and that it shouldn't have won any of the awards it did, because it was not good at all. Big budget doesn't necessarily mean big hit. In this case, it means big dumb movie.",3/10
Beautiful and timeless,evancyl,1 February 2014,"A timeless classic, Titanic combines a moving story, an excellent cast and a beautiful screenplay, set against the greatest shipwreck in the world. Two young people from opposite ends of the social spectrum fall in love aboard the 'unsinkable' Titanic. Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), a lovely and spirited 17-year-old aristocrat, is forced into an engagement with the haughty and controlling Cal Hockley, heir to steel millions, so as to rescue her family's fortunes. Feeling trapped, she decides to jump into the ocean but is stopped by Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). Although poor, Jack is enterprising and courageous and full of fun, and the two quickly fall in love. But Cal will not let things rest, and pursues them doggedly even as the ship is sinking. I like how the movie began in the future, with 102-year-old Rose telling her story to the salvage crew hunting for the famed blue diamond, the Heart of the Ocean. As alluring as treasure is, the listeners are soon captivated by one of the most beautiful love stories ever told. There were so many memorable moments and scenes, from the first half-teasing, half-serious encounter to Jack's parting words to Rose. Everybody should watch this!",10/10

One of my all-time favourites. Yes.,dy158,19 June 2006,"When I say that, I am not kidding anyone. Had I knew it earlier, I will have posted my review here beforehand. I had watched it once when it was at the cinemas here (and someone I know actually watched more than once!), watched twice or something when it was on the television here. The last time was like few years back on the television.It goes to show how much I so love the movie, despite some may think now it's cheesy to bring it up. Hey, this was a box office winner and it's still at the top here in terms of ticket earnings for an opening release of a movie, from what I know. And whenever I heard Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On', I will almost become a drama mama. Literally.Interstingly, I first remembered back then some years back in my school days, I was doing a comprehension passage about the cruise liner prior to the movie's release and the thing at that time, I had never thought much about the comprehension passage I did after that. I had never thought that it will become a big blockbuster of the time few years later it came out. Till I (even) begged my family that I wanted to go watch it at the cinema (which it happened). I know it's all fiction in the movie about the love story of Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCapirio) before watching it.The entire movie setting is almost perfect and it will almost bring you back of the era when the actual cruise liner had its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York. Even as I was watching each time, I had often wished I am boarding a luxury cruise liner (still waiting for that day). Anyone can dream.I have to kind of admit, interestingly, I never cried (but just felt deeply moved then) towards the end of the movie when I first saw it but subsequently when it was on the television here, tears almost started to come out of my eyes.Almost a real perfect masterpiece. Just don't care what others will say.",9/10

"Cool sinkage, bad linage",t_brown_17,19 October 2000,"Leonardo is a great actor. In THIS BOY'S LIFE (his best role), he plays a troubled youth with an abusive stepfather. In THE BASKETBALL DIARIES (his 2nd best role), he plays a troubled youth with a heroine abuse problem. In ROMEO & JULIET (his 3rd best role), he plays a troubled youth with a love problem. In TITANIC (his 6th best role), he plays a troubled youth with a sinking boat problem. In the 4 years between BOY'S LIFE and TITANIC, you'd think Leo would be able to master the whole troubled youth role (which he also played, and better, in Marvin's room). But it's still at the same level: energetic yet empty; loose yet fragmented; forceful yet tentative. The script doesn't help, though. In a word, it's awful. Kate Winslet towers over Leo here, and seeing her naked was a lot more rewarding experience than it is seeing her bare it all in HOLY SMOKE. Kate and Leo, however, make a good team, and they make it seem like they really love eachother. Though their tacky lines are an obstacle to cross. This could have been a great film.

Very dissapointing movie,JJHH,23 September 1999,"This movie had it's themes backwards: the part about the Titanic itself was incredibly well done, and very suspenseful.

A masterpiece,crukeg,17 October 2007,"Titanic is one of the best films of all time for many reasons. There is not one single problem with the picture. Not one.

This makes the film an experience instead of just entertainment.Titanic has been bashed by many people for years. All I can say is that i think it is the second best film ever (behind shawshank), and that i don't care what they think.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate winslet are stunning and they give the film a basic story structure. Now these people can act.James Cameron cleverly shows the peril that the passengers are in. We can relate to them, and we fear for them. It is horrifying to see them die.

If you can stand sitting for 3 and a half hours just watching Leonardo Dicaprio complain because he's in love with a girl thats too classy for him, then this is the movie for you. The only reason this made so much money was because of that Dicaprio guy and not the fact it was a good movie. If you want to see a good movie that involves a ship sinking at the end, watch Jaws. At least that had excitement. I have to say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen >",No Rating

Titanic A Long But Well Made Tragic Adventure Love Story,tburke85,13 June 2009,"Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. Writer/Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good on-screen couple. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.",8/10

"Breathtaking, Classic, Unforgettable",Aly200,30 July 2012,"James Cameron's timeless tale of forbidden love and the tragic sinking of the colossal Titanic is a beloved classic in its own right. The story this movie tells always tugs at my heart each time I see it. The emphasis of the terrible fate of the Titanic is heightened by the tragic love story that backs up the short time-line of the glorious ship as it heads towards its fate. The cast is fabulous, magnificent and really breathes life into their characters to make them realistic. Leonardo DiCaprio as the care- free, young and handsome Jack Dawson is the embodiment of who we all wish to be like in life whereas Kate Winslet's Rose DeWitt Bukater embodies where we lie in life if we don't attempt to break free and try and live a new life or experience a different world. The beauty of how real the film is adds to the majesty of the film's grandeur to the details of the ship the crew built and the characters that died or survived the disaster inhabit the structure. Anyone who loves an epic should check out this fantastic tale of love, tragedy and survival.",8/10
"At least, ""Titanic"" will never sink ... into oblivion ...",ElMaruecan82,23 October 2011,"""Titanic"" was the cinematic phenomenon of the 90's and the worldwide highest grossing film of all time before being dethroned by ""Avatar"", from James Cameron (the only director who could ever beat James Cameron in the box-office). Now, ""Titanic"" has become the quintessential cool-to-hate film, hence one of the most controversial Best Picture winners, which is surprising because if anything, the movie screams 'Best Picture'. There's something quite unique in the way the huge success of ""Titanic"" became a defining key of detestation, challenging any attempt for a rational appreciation. Well, we're in 2011 now : the hype has passed, CGI became a tiresome trend providing a series of unoriginal special-effects-driven films, Kate won an Oscar and Scorsese injected some cinematic botox on Leo's ex-pretty-boy face. In these circumstances, I believe we have enough distance to judge ""Titanic"" again, regardless of all the peripheral elements that contributed to its success, back then, in 1997 ¬ÖWhen ""Titanic"" was released, I was the kind of teenager who avoided any mainstream phenomenon, needless to say that I categorically refused to be brainwashed by the ""Titanic"" wave. The film was the absolute must-see and the girls were all drooling over Di Caprio, and you couldn't listen to the radio or watch TV musical programs without having the annoying flute of Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"". I was far from imagining that this music would define my personal nostalgia of the late 90's. Then the movie grabbed 11 Oscars, it was the most watched and re-watched film ever and I even had to make an essay about ""Titanic"" at school, where I eagerly expressed that the 'Iceberg story left me cold'But suddenly something strange happened. The bubble of popularity popped, some little fellows displayed a childish pride of having disliked the film. And I can't count how many girls were so pleased to say that Leo was too girlish, when one year before, he had an 'angel face'. Then I reversed my position, and from the enthusiasm of having avoided the film, I wanted to understand why people were being so hypocritical with their own appreciation, and feel guilty as if they admired a naked Emperor, with all flash and no substance. This is how ""Titanic"" gradually became the 'cool-to-hate' film, because it's always cool to hate popular stuff, but it's so uncool to try to be cool so this was my personal encouragement to give it a chance in 1999, and to know where I stood for. I came, I saw and I liked it.I'm not even afraid to admit that I loved it, it had everything I was expecting, it was spectacular, thrilling, romantic, and didn't rely too much on special effects except for the terrific sinking part. Yes, the film flirts with cinematic clich√©s sometimes, the whole 'follow your heart' message is almost Disney-like, but this is the point of the film, it's the romance with the Titanic as a setting, not the Titanic's story featuring a romance. When we think of ""Titanic"", we have less the image of the ship breaking in half in our minds, than Kate and Leo flying over the sunset, this is the defining image of the film and one of the most iconic of American Cinema. And this is the strength of the film.A few recent movies have managed to achieve a classic status so quickly, and so impacting the way ""Titanic"" did and this is certainly due to the constant symbiosis between the story and the special effects that provided the 'classic' vibe, and whether it was intentional or not, it sure succeeded. ""Titanic"" has the thrills, the romance, and an inspirational message, simple enough to appeal to all the sensitive hearts all over the world. And seriously, let's not get too cynical about the marketing campaign, and deny the artistic value of some of the most financially successful films. There's a time for Independent films and another one for spectacular blockbusters ¬Ö as long as there is a good story, justifying the use of special effects, and the exhilarating sinking sequence.""Titanic"" had the intelligence to have a sort of classic story that could appeal on a universal level. A love story undermined by a tragedy, it's sad and inspiring, a love story between a rich aristocratic woman and a third-class youthful and optimistic boy, it's universal, the whole tragedy of the ""Titanic"" has been touched by a cinematic grace that made it one of the greatest American classics, and I mean 'great' in the classic meaning of the world. And I better take an innocent story, even naive, rather than a spectacular but dull one, like ""Independence Day"" one year before or a thought-provoking but manipulative one, like ""Saving Private Ryan"" the year after. So, I loved ""Titanic"", I felt for the characters, the part where one mother reads a story for her children while the ship sinks will haunt me forever, the music beautifully conveys the innate sadness of a rather passionate romance. The film revives the greatest tradition of the disaster genre with a perfectionism that finally paid-off, and I applaud James Cameron for that. And now, I wonder what the haters hate in the film, what makes ""Lord of the Rings"" so deeper than ""Titanic"", love story, good vs. evil? Don't they miss the young Leo who could smile and shout even the cringe-worthy ""king of the world"" line? Regarding the actual cinematic trends, ""Titanic"" is a classic among the classics and the deserving Best Picture of 1997.So, I don't find any particular reason to hate this film, and if I ever found one, let's say ¬Ö uh, the part with the necklace which I didn't really care for, well, for one reason to dislike the film, I can find ten to love it. Disliking ""Titanic"" just because it was once so popular is simply a titanic mistake",9/10
"Big ship moons audience, makes a zillion dollars",tieman64,22 December 2009,"""Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal."" ‚Äì Albert Einstein Most damn the ""romantic subplot"" at the heart of ""Titanic"" and overlook the larger romance that extends throughout director James Cameron's filmography. This is not just a film about the budding love between two characters on a ship, but about man's love affair with technology.Cameron presents Titanic as a modern marvel. A beautiful ocean liner, with sleek lines, sensual curves and chrome plumbing. His camera caresses the ship, bathing it in sunsets, starlight and pinkish hues. It's not only a stage for romance, but the embodiment of romance. A kind of fetishized symbol for man's, and Cameron's, love for technology; his godlike desire to lord over his landscape with machines. The name ""Titanic"" is itself suggestive of an almost divine or Olympian creation.Of course the ship then hits a chunk of ice and promptly sinks. Cameron's camera then surveys the carnage, watching with delight as the machine goes down, taking a couple hundred passengers with it. This is not just a maritime disaster. This is judgement day, the machines rebelling against their creators.One character, an artist called Jack, goes down with the ship, but not before saving the life of a plump girl called Rose. Man's creative spirit may sink into the void, but it is promptly revitalised by the blossoming of Rose, a previously reticent young woman who regains her spark through contact with Jack.This tension takes place throughout Cameron's filmography. His films are all about beautiful machines violently rebelling against their makers. This push-pull tension itself infects Cameron's work methods, for he is a director obsessed with machines, but who spends his career warning us of the very robots he creates, promotes, proliferates and relies on.What's strange, though, is that Cameron's latest film not only repeats this message, but then goes further into a kind of hippie utopianism. ""Avatar"", a zillion dollar action fantasy shot in 3D, features a world in which aliens use their ""brain stems"" to literally plug into trees, animals and nature. For Cameron, technology is not only evil, it now prevents us from ""connecting to nature"". ""Nature is what's real"", Cameron says, populating his film with aliens who ""hook up"" to a kind of biological network. Cameron takes the cables, modems, routers, telephones and computers of the modern world, and turns them into their biological equivalents, trees, roots and bodies linked by organic conduits. ""Avatar's"" aliens even store their entire history on a ""harddrive"" in the form of a giant tree. In other words, the ""internet"" should be ""out there"". All should be dependent on physical connections to nature, not virtual connections mediated via machines.But there is always a danger of ""naturalising"" nature. The natural world is not some kind of utopia to which we can return in balanced harmony. Man has always been at war with nature and nature itself is not a balanced system. It is a mass of conflicting bodies, constantly adapting, jostling, vying for position, always changing. This kind of fetishizing of nature, the need to turn it into some kind of mystical utopia, is the same kind of confused thinking that led to designer-Buddhism becoming popular in the 60s. Indeed, ""Avatar"" only works because Cameron romanticises the ""noble savages"" in his film, portraying them as ""kind hearted"" ""mystical creatures"" who are ""one with the land"". Compare this to someone like Herzog or Terrence Malick, who constantly crash the Romantic ideal of nature with post-Enlightenment thinking.Then there's the ironic fact that though Cameron's films have all been cautionary tales about technology, he is the biggest techno-whore in all of Hollywood. For a zillion dollar film to be so pro-chlorophyll reeks of hypocrisy. Reconnect to nature via CGI jungles? It's like Bill Gates telling us to get back in touch with trees...but BUY WINDOWS VISTA because that's where the real vistas are.So with its computer generated jungles and CGI ships, these two films are really showcases for technology. They don't ask us to consider our relationship with tech, but push us further into hyper-reality, further into the simulacrum, selling us the notion that technology can offer us ""more nature than nature can"". High definition TV, 3D film, wide screen, youtube videos, surround sound etc...technology is nature without the hassle (technology is itself nature, part of our extended phenotype). It is nature purified by machines. This all has the opposite effect of Cameron's message, people retreating further ""inwards"" into their ""utopian homes"" rather than plugging into the ""outside"". And why not? To homo-sapien 21C, ""nature"" isn't real enough anymore. It lacks the definition of the simulacrum.Imagine a director like Cronenberg handling a film like ""Titanic"" or ""Avatar"". Mybe he'd focus on ""Avatar's"" more disturbing, unconscious elements. That this is a film about a guy who is essentially ""watching a film"". That the hero needs to be comatose and ""asleep in a machine"" to experience a better life. That his virtual experiences are more ""real"" than his limited body. That the cast themselves require ""avatars suits"". That their performances are all ""virtual"". That the 3D nature of the picture requires one to wear glasses to view it, the distance from subject to fantasy constantly meta-morphing. And so revisiting all of Cameron's films, it's clear that ""Aliens"" and ""The Terminator"" represent him at his peak. Each successive film has been increasingly childish, his exponentially inflated mega-budgets dictating that his films cast a net across as wide a demographic as possible. The super-violent R-rated worlds of ""The Terminator"" and ""Aliens"" are now too niche market, the director succumbing to the machine that is the almighty dollar. And the further Cameron gets from the B-movie masculinity of his early career, the more simple minded and proselytising his films get.8/10 - Oscilates from jaw-droppingly spectacular to cringe-worthy.",No Rating
Apparently the best film ever made!!!,"David, Film Freak",7 November 2000,"Breathtaking it was not. Amazing? I don't think so. Brilliant? Yeah right! The best movie ever made? Not even close. Yet, the Box Office would make out that this pathetic attempt to reinact a tragic undertaking (which has been reinacted more times than I care to count) was actually pretty good. Very good, even. Hell - because of the soppy do-gooders of the world that went to see this, it's the Highest Grossing movie of all time, and we're told that it's a 'wonderful tale, with wonderful actors, a wonderful script and wonderful sets'.PULEEEEEESE! There is absolutely no talent in Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet or Billy Zane, the sets were completely overdone, and unrealistically fake, the script was complete Loserville-ish and boring.The only part that was good was when Rose was going to fall off the ship, and when that guy gets hit by the ship propeller at the end.

"The definition of ""a movie""",lorcan-61881,27 September 2018,"If you have not seen Titanic, I'm sure you've heard of it, and of so, please do watch it because not only is the film a ""great watch"" or a great ""thrill ride of suspense and emotional scenes"", but Titanic is one of the greatest films of all time. The film has some of the best acting from Winslet and DiCaprio and some of the best character chemistry between them. The direction lead by James Cameron is phenomenal. The ending to the film is one of the most intense, beautiful and sad endings I've ever seen, i can not remark one flaw about it. The cinematography is great and the film has some of the best and most memorable shots in cinema history (yes, that including the scene where Jack holds Rose up at the ship deck). The soundtrack is amazing, including Celine Dion's fantastic song that totally fits the feel of the film. Titanic is a must watch, one i would have killed for to see on the big screen!

Technically masterful,YFL,10 August 1999,"As an epic, it doesn't change, even a little, my perception of life. As a love story, I've seen better.

"Truly of a ""Titanic"" scale...",general-melchett,8 February 2007,"Why Titanic isn't on the Top 250, I just don't know. It is, by far, the most successful film of all time, and deservedly so. Nobody could have captured with such emotion and scope the depiction of what happened in the Atlantic 95 years ago except James Cameron. Terminator 3 and this had the same budget - Terminator 3 was good, but this film blew me away. It truly raises the bar for film-making and success in the film industry. It has been a couple of years since I last saw this film, and my memory starts to fail me. But you just can't forget some of the special effects on this film and how they changed the world of films. Monumental images that stick in your mind forever are created with grand scale to breathtaking effect, and the film stays emotional throughout its three hours - so you always care. This film was made to win Oscars, and win Oscars it did. Though Lord of the Rings: Return of the King managed to win all of its nominations (Titanic did have 14 nominations and won 11), box office grosses and general audience feelings will always precede Titanic as the better film. Truly a Titanic achievement... 10/10",10/10
Too big to fail.,CuriosityKilledShawn,24 January 1999,"Titanic wasn't the first attempt at turning the sinking of the big boat into a theatrical epic, but it's by far the best and will never, ever be bettered. Cameron's minute attention to detail, commitment to realism, and epic vision are light years ahead of the German Propaganda version, a Night to Remember (where the ship sinks whole), the dull Catherine Zeta Jones version, or the tawdry ITV mini-series.The hugeness of the production is every bit as impressive at the ship, and the savage critics predicted that the film was doomed to fail as hard as its subject matter. Nope! Titanic went on to be a $2 billion hit and scoop 11 Academy Awards.Despite the many positive reviews there are always film snobs who love to pick faults in popular culture phenomenons. But I think Titanic is more than that and doesn't deserve any nit-picking. It's easy to focus on inconsequential details, but Titanic has few faults. The worst I can say of it is that Leo DiCaprio's acting is sometimes a bit aggravating. Apparently Macauley Culkin was considered for the part of Jack Dawson. Now THAT was have been awesome.Many snobs have called the characters flat and uninteresting. It's hard to develop such a wide cast in a film set within a short space of time (not including the 84 year time-span of the story). But the two and a bit days that the ship manages to sail before it sinks does have plenty of drama and development so anyone who complains otherwise is just deliberately being fickle. I don't even think that Billy Zane comes across as a caricature, as others have gleefully pointed out. Caledon Hockley IS actually a complex, and somewhat sympathetic character. I know he's the antagonist (or maybe the iceberg is), but the fact that he still searches for Rose on the deck of the Carpathia means that he really does love her, in a way.Once the iceberg hits, at the 100-minute mark, the editing and timing (not quite real-time, but close) is perfect. The growing panic matches the rising water as Captain Smith walks around in a daze, completely unable to be believe that it REALLY IS HAPPENING. The hole in the hull doesn't seem to be a problem at first, but two hours later anyone not on a lifeboat is doomed.In a way it's an end-of-the-world movie as much as a romance or disaster. The Titanic was a microcosm of human society, and despite its status as the biggest ship ever built it really was a tiny, fragile speck on a dark, unforgiving ocean. Even as a child, long before I ever saw the film, I thought that the sinking of it represented the futility of mankind trying to conquer the ocean and the meaningless of wealth.It's a very different film from Terminator or True Lies, but James Cameron has always kept a gritty, earthy tone to his movie. Titanic isn't, but his commitment to realism keeps it consistent to his other movies.I don't think it's the best movie ever, but it scores almost full marks for everything. Titanic deserves to be seen on the big screen, which is why I have only seen it twice. The new 3D conversion looks great, and with a few corrections to the content of the film, and the digital projection itself, now really IS the time to revisit the ship.",8/10
Spoiled by commercialism,lists-9,2 June 2002,"This is a moderately entertaining film, but overlong and certainly not deserving of multiple Oscars. I've found that, on video, it's best watched in several sessions! I was an early fan of James Cameron and am depressed to see the extent that success has led him to excess. As in THE ABYSS, the director's self-importance seems to radiate from the screen.I'm surprised at how few people comment on the music. To me it is the most trite, tacky and clumsy part of the whole thing. Whenever we hear the theme that goes with the horrible song ""The heart will go on"" - which is often! - whatever mood James Cameron has managed to create is destroyed. This is particularly grating towards the end. I found this film's music score particularly disappointing bearing in mind that James Horner has written some excellent film scores.",6/10
The Second Worst Movie Ever,cyberknight,7 April 2005,"The first time I commented on this movie, I gave it a really harsh review. Since then, nothing has changed, but I'm going easier this time.Two titles come to mind when reviewing it: ""Natural Born Killers"" (NBK) and ""Gone with The Wind"" (GwTW). Till ""Titanic"", the worst and the second worst movies I've ever seen. NBK is by far the worst. It has an excellent director, a good writer, good to very good actors and, even so, it managed to be completely empty, with some spectacular sequences gone completely to waste in meaningless situations (like the wonderful gray-scale prison sequence). GwTW is another meaningless work, but it never had any chance, with terrible speeches, a director that didn't know what he was doing and a story that would have thrown it into oblivion if it was not settle in the American civil war (it has some ""historical value"", or so I was told).Back to ""Titanic"", the first obvious problem is the plot. At one side, there is this young lady, about to get married to a rich man, an educated pig, but still a pig. On the other side, there is that young man, handsome, good-hearted and a gifted artist. The only problem is that the young artist is poor, but, mind you, the lady is rich already! It was absolutely impossible for her to not fall in love with the artist. The only conflict possible is the jealousy of the rich man against the poor artist. Predictable, to say the least. Then, when everybody have fallen for the new happy couple, the ship sinks. I'm absolutely sure that people wouldn't have cried so much if everybody had died. The whole story is extremely predictable. Worse, it is made predictable.How did ""Titanic"" take the second place from GwTW? Well, it took a lot of cash to do that... Cameron wanted a real sized ship to be able to effectively send it to the bottom. Fine, it's not my money. Then we see the result on the big screen, and now it is our money! Since ""Indiana Jones 3"", I hadn't seen such a lousy chroma-key. When you see the passengers falling into the sea, it looks like they were filmed against a projection, like in the original ""King Solomon's Mines"" movie. That alone, I wouldn't have minded so much. Then you watch Cameron commenting on the box-office success of ""Titanic"" and his claim that it was due to his attention to details... Even if that statement was true, there is one more problem: the big things are all wrong, why care about the details?It was not easy to put the about four hours ""Gone with The Wind"" on third place, but Cameron made it possible in about three hours. He has a talent for blockbusters, it's too bad he cannot also make them good movies.",1/10

"Well Done, yet over rated",Quinoa1984,22 March 2000,"James Francis Cameron's Titanic is a well done film, but I think it gets more credit than it deserves.  True, the film won eleven Academy awards (including 3 for Cameron and 2 for composer James Horner), but I think it shouldn't had been ranked so high- like with Ben-Hur status.If you don't know the story of Titanic now, your probably one of the ones who didn't survive because the story is world-renoun.  So are it's actors (Leonardo DiCaprio is not at his best, Kate Winslet is at least hot, and Billy Zane works as a villain) who work into Jim Cameron's script about romance on the high seas.  Luckily, the film doesn't go as slow as you may think, but still, that's no excuse to have the Titanic sinking in the movie longer than it did in  real life.But seriously, this film does have many great qualitites.  The story is well lay out, and the special effects are dazzling (it actually looks like the Titanic is sinking) which also won a Oscar.  One of the great points in this film is the score by James Horner which is his best and one of the best ever, but that is over-shadowed by fancy fireworks and bad acting.  Good direction though.  B",7/10
Timeless Magnificence,ytpakkys,10 February 2019,"It's been a long time since I last watched Titanic. I remembered some questionable dialogues and scenes from the last time I watched but what I had missed was something I had forgotten. The true essence of Titanic. The unending love for the story told in a way it was told. For another eight years, I was ignorant to it.
I recently saw a clip of Titanic which got me pumped to watch it again. I started watching with my brother who never liked Titanic for reasons I couldn't understand.
This time, not only did I remember what I missed, I felt the love with which it was made. Such magnificence. The story, style, chemistry of the actors and the characters being played, direction, score. Everything blended together to show why Titanic was ever popular! By the end of it, I was almost in tears with even the one watching with me praising it. And I finally witnessed what I was missing... Titanic. The way the story is told to eventually end on a note which would bring anyone to tears. It's perfection and to describe my experience in words in really difficult. I was enchanted, happy, sad and whatnot!
This is a timeless masterpiece and will continue to be for all times to come.",10/10
"Mostly historically accurate, but badly focused",kyle-cruse,10 September 2008,"When this film first came out, I was a Titanic buff and read as many books and saw as many documentaries on the actual ship as I could get my hands on. As I result, I realized the great lengths James Cameron went to in order to make ""Titanic"" as historically accurate as possible, in terms of the events of the ship itself. The film is perfectly done in that way, as it is the most realistic film about the Titanic ever made, in my opinion. Nevertheless, it is not nearly a perfect film, and I'll tell you why. All the young girls in the world will kill me for this, but I feel that the film is far too focused on the fictional romance between Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). This is not the first time a fictional story has found its way into a Titanic film (take the 1953 version with Clifton Webb for example). Being such a buff on the real Titanic, I did not like how so much of the film was focused on this story. What I really wanted was true historical facts about the tragedy shown on film. The story does not really need to be spiced up. It is tragic and fascinating, with tons of little interesting details, all on its own. It is truly a great story simply written by God himself. If you enjoy the romance between Jack and Rose, you're not alone. That seems to be why most people love this film. Nevertheless, I found all of the facts about the Titanic in this film to be completely accurate and well-portrayed. It is a worthwhile film for just about anyone. Not worthy of all 11 Oscars, though. ""Good Will Hunting"" is what should have won that year. Of course, this does have that great original song ""My Heart Goes On,"" definitely worthy of its Oscar.*** out of ****",8/10

A modern old-fashioned classic,kira02bit,29 November 2006,"This film shares a lot of parallels with the legendary Gone With the Wind. It is a romantic spectacle set against the backdrop of historical events and became both a huge Oscar-winning success and the surprise box office behemoth of its era. Another similarity it shares with the former is that following the success it is now considered ""hip"" to be derogatory and dismiss it as a Hollywood film. It is a Hollywood film, but not in the insulting manner that detractors would indicate. It is a sublime demonstration of what can happen when a visionary director puts his reputation on the line and uses the limits of what Hollywood has to offer to bring it to the screen.The film opens in present day with a group of scientific treasure hunters exploring the remains of the sunken Titanic in an effort to locate a priceless necklace. Instead, they find a preserved portrait of a young woman. The elderly woman, Rose (Gloria Stuart), is located and brought to the site to relate her story of the last days of the Titanic and the film unfolds. It is a familiar romantic tale with rich-in-name-only Rose (now played by Kate Winslet) betrothed against her will to a boorish millionaire. In a fit of pique, she contemplates suicide and is talked out of it by charming penniless artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). During the remainder of the ill-fated voyage, they fall in love and incur the wrath of her fianc√© and her mother, until the fateful iceberg and destiny in the icy waters of the North Atlantic intervene.There are so many ways that the film could have gone wrong, but director James Cameron wisely sidesteps them. Much of the fuel used by the detractors of the film would have turned it into an infinitely weaker production. Evidence of Cameron's sure narrative hand can be found in numerous spots. Starting the film with the treasure hunters provides for a brilliant moment which allows them to recreate on a computer the death throes of the Titanic so that when the final 90 minutes begin the viewer is completely aware of why certain things are occurring as they do. It also offers a wonderful opportunity for 1930s film star Gloria Stuart to show her acting chops as the latter day Rose.Cameron also gives us a strong scope of the immensity of the great ship herself, as well as the class differentiation in the status of the clientele traveling therein. Much has been made of centering the film on the two characters of Jack and Rose, while having the remainder of the cast play support rather than spread the wealth around more. One could and has done that: it is called The Poseidon Adventure. The reason why this film works on so many levels is because it is far more than the standard disaster epic. The fact that the action is basically consolidated through the eyes of young lovers streamlines the film and keeps the action focused, and Cameron comes up with increasingly inventive ways to move them through different parts of the ship to cover as much action as possible. The fact that they are young lovers experiencing their first romance provides a vitality and sense of urgency that may have been missing from older protagonists. Many have sneered over much the ""Jack"" ""Rose"" ""Jack"" dialog interaction in the climactic moments as a lack of good writing, but given that we are talking about teenage lovers in serious peril, one wonders if people expected them to quote intellectual diatribes back and forth. Instead, what comes from their mouths is far more likely and believable, if repetitive. Further, look at how often Cameron takes the narrative high road. When Jack is invited by the rich people to join them for dinner for saving Rose early in the film, he could have punctured the egos of the rich and wowed Rose with his coarseness. Instead, he behaves in a totally mature fashion and ends up charming the majority of those at their table. The film is brimming with memorable sequences, including the highly sensual moment when Rose invites Jack to draw her portrait or the (much parodied) scene of the two lovers embracing at the front of the ship as it skims the water. For detractors that claim that the special effects involving the sinking of the Titanic save the film, it makes their argument untenable when so many audiences have already been won over long before the sinking begins. The climactic moments are intense, heart-breaking and unforgettable.The majority of the film's success (aside from Cameron) must be attributed to the leads. I would never have previously cast them as a couple, but DiCaprio and Winslet have chemistry. Not just any chemistry, but the chemistry of which cinematic legends are made. Winslet provides a warm, sympathetic and resonant presence throughout the film portraying a character that proves much stronger than even she initially believes. She draws you into the action and her final moments rank as some of her best acting. Conversely, although I admit DiCaprio is a good actor, I am not usually much of a fan. Here, I cannot see anyone else in this role. It is a distinct departure from anything else that he has attempted and he has no acting ""hook"" on which to hinge his work. Playing a larger-than-life character that clicks with the audience is one of the trickiest obstacles, but when Rose declares that ""he saved me in every way that a person can be saved"" DiCaprio makes you believe it. The fact that he makes it appear so effortless probably resulted in his Oscar nomination snub, but the truth is that he is definitely the worthy Gable to Winslet's Leigh.",9/10

Titanic,jonathandecooman,26 February 2023,"Titanic is a film that deeply affects the viewer. The direction and photography are breathtaking, with wide panoramic shots to give an overview of the ship, and close-up shots to focus on the characters and emotional moments. The color palette used is rich and vibrant, with a predominance of warm, golden tones to accentuate the romantic mood of the film. The fluid movements of the camera give the impression that the viewer is actually walking aboard the ship. The scenes where the ship sinks are particularly memorable, with tight and chaotic shots that give the impression that the viewer is drowning alongside the characters.The emotions conveyed by the film are also very strong. The love story between Jack and Rose is very moving, and the performances of the actors allow the viewer to become attached to these characters from the beginning of the film. The scenes of panic, chaos, and death aboard the ship are heartbreaking and allow the viewer to feel the terror that the passengers must have experienced during this tragedy. The universal themes addressed, such as social class, discrimination, family, and death, touch each of us in one way or another. These themes are addressed with great sensitivity and emotional depth, allowing the viewer to identify with the characters and feel their pain and joy.The music of the film, especially the song ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion, is also very emotional and contributes to reinforcing the emotional impact of the film. The song is immediately recognizable and is often associated with the love story of Jack and Rose, which further reinforces the emotional impact of their story.Finally, the conclusion of the film is very emotional and tragic, with the death of Jack in the icy waters of the Atlantic. This ending is one of the most heartbreaking moments of the film, with Rose surviving but having to say goodbye to the love of her life. However, this conclusion is necessary to reinforce the emotional depth of the film and to make it an unforgettable masterpiece.In summary, Titanic is a film that manages to touch the heart of the viewer through its stunning direction and photography, universal themes, emotional music, and poignant conclusion. It is a film that continues to evoke strong emotions in viewers even after all these years, which is a testament to its exceptional quality.",10/10
James Cameron is a HACK and aTitanic is easily the most OVERRATED film of all time and that's a FACT!,broaded,5 April 2018,"Titanic is definitely by far the most OVERRATED motion picture of all time, filled with two idiotic and selfish lead characters that overlooks to true tragedy of the sinking of the great ocean liner.While the sinking of the Titanic is somewhat impressive, it's filled with James Cameron and his usual bad screenwriting. Cameron has often said he hates screenwriting and his awful scripts for True Lies, Titanic and Avatar all prove it, his dialogue is atrocious, I mean if I hear ""I'm the king of the world"" again I want to vomit and using his same line at the Oscars is a new low for how selfish Cameron is with his inflated ego.Jack and Rose are two of the most annoying characters to ever be seen on the big screen, when the boat finally sinks (after watching over two hours of endless boredom) the film finally has a pulse, but suffering with the two lead characters and their immaturity and selfishness really brings the film down to mediocre,, even awful levels.James Cameron is a HACK, he has no original ideas, he steals ideas from others (such as Terminator was really based on an episode of The Outer Limits, Aliens was a sequel to a far superior original film, True Lies was originally a French action spy comedy, Titanic was really Romeo and Juliet aboard the doomed ocean liner, and Avatar was nothing more than a science fiction version of Dances With Wolves, mixed with the 1'992 animated feature FernGully.All in all Cameron is an egotistical maniac, who often clashes with his actors and crews and makes mediocre films at best, and that is a solid FACT!",1/10
Decent Drama with brilliant Sets,dr_shallowgrave,30 October 2004,"Titanic is a fair work from director James Cameron. Sometimes being called on the carpet for it's naive plot and dialogue, this movie had the rare merit of reuniting the public and the critics in an unanimous way: James Cameron's Titanic is an effective work to be remembered. This does not happen so often. For several weeks, this movie had the privilege to score brilliantly on the top charts, as well as conquering major movie awards around the world. Is it fair? Was it overrated? That does not matter, if we accept it for what it stands. It worked perfectly. The artwork is ostentatious and the acting if not perfect is adequate and balanced with the strength of the script written by Cameron himself. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the necessary honesty to the role, while Kate Winslet grants the wit, elegance and grace that a romantic and troubled heroin should have. Miss Winslet was without any doubt the finest actress for the role. Apart from the supremacy of the visual effects, which are the main core of this movie for most of its viewers, Titanic dazzles for the truth and sensibility present in every single detail in every scene. More than a parade of mere flash-backs from an old lady who once was ""a dish"", this movie is a fine drama made with a solid sense of loyalty and respect for the viewer. You know what happens before you pay for your ticket. You know it is a love story set on a transatlatic and you know people will die. What matters, most of all, is the possibility Cameron gives you to imagine what might have been if you had the chance to find true love under the most ungrateful circumstances. 8 out of 10 for Cameron's sensibility and courage to write a story without having any previous experience as a screen-writer; 10/10 for a brilliant Kate Winslet, a beautiful and talented British actress who proved that acting skills do not have nationality nor beauty patterns. I had fun watching it. It made me feel like I was sharing the inner conflicts felt by the main characters. For its truth and audacity to tell a story already told a thousand times, I bow with respect.9/10",9/10
"Visually, Titanic was a stunning masterpiece, but the story and the acting were mediocre and sometimes just outright bad.",Anonymous_Maxine,30 August 2000,"At first glance, Titanic is an epic film. The scenery and cinematogrpahy are spectacular, and it is just a beautifully photographed movie. However, when you look past the superficial beauty of the film, much like Armageddon, its numerous shortcomings become clear. First of all, Titanic suffered badly from the transition from the big screen to video. This took away a lot of the hugeness of the film, and this inadvertently places more attention on the story and the acting, both of which were the biggest problems with the film. I went to see this movie to see the sinking of the Titanic, not to see some elaborately fabricated love story. Titanic is a landmark film as a result of the sinking of the ship and the fact that it inexplicably turned out to be such a huge moneymaker. There is absolutely nothing great about the acting, the story is nothing that hasn't been seen dozens of times before, and the directing is awkward, probably due to the fact that James Cameron, who is an excellent director, is so used to directing the Frankenstein-like Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. This is not to say that the directing was bad, it wasn't at all, but there is nothing special to be said about the directing because James Cameron is not really a director of this type of film.Kate Winslet was beautiful in Titanic. She delivered a wonderful performance in the film and was very convincing, as was Kathy Bates (as always) and even Billy Zane. I normally don't like him, but he was playing a dislikeable character, which is probably why I enjoyed his performance so much. Leonardo DiCaprio, however, delivered the worst performance of his career. If you want to see him really act, watch The Basketball Diaries or, even better, The Beach. Titanic is a beautifully made film. It suffered in the story and the acting departments, but it is an entertaining and easy to watch movie. It was not, however, the best picture of 1997. Not even close. There were probably 20 movies that were released in 1997 that were better than Titanic, but the Oscar's wouldn't have gained as much public support had they not given the Oscar to Titanic. It was a quality film, but don't be fooled by all of the hype.",6/10
An overrated piece of dross...,bartonim,16 January 2007,"I'm one of the cynics, and am quite proud of it, thanks. I cannot fathom why this film received any Oscars apart from anything for special effects (in that department, it excels). Yes, the actual cracking apart and sinking of the legendary ocean liner was extremely well done. But as for the rest, just one word: disappointment.First, there's Leo--not a terrible actor, but pretty limited here. And Kate? About the same goes for her. Then, there is the story. It would have been more interesting if it had focused on the lives of others who were actually on the ship--including the crew. It's also painfully over-long, AND it has a Celine Dion song to boot. How much more wrong can it possibly get? An overrated piece of dross indeed.",3/10

!Such a beautiful love story. one of the most legendary movies ever made, and i love it so much!
So acting is really amazing, leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are both so talented and they nailed their parts! the plot is super good, and i don't think this classic contains any negative things, except jack's death and the fact that this movie is very sad.. but i'm still like this film

"An epic, a classic, and one of the greatest love stories of all time",cinemaniac_x,28 December 2010,"What movie comes to mind when you think of compelling, memorable characters, spectacular visual effects, a fantastic score, and a beautiful, tragic plot? What movie has captured the hearts and imagination of people of all ages around the world? What movie has retained its charm and ¬≠appeal for over a decade, and has earned a rightful place in cinematic history? The answer is Titanic, the 1997 film that opened with low expectations and then astounded the public with its massive success. As the highest-grossing film of all time and winner of 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Titanic raises hopes for moviegoers and does not disappoint.First, consider an undertaking so daunting that many would deem it impossible: recreating the RMS Titanic and its fateful sinking. This task undoubtedly required much time, skill, and effort, not to mention a huge budget ‚Äì at the time, Titanic was the most expensive film ever made. The ship's splendor shines throughout the movie and adds an atmosphere of magic that film sets rarely manage.Another element of the film's success is the superb, talented cast. Most notably, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet give commanding performances as Jack and Rose, the young star-crossed lovers separated by ¬≠social class on the maiden voyage of the doomed vessel. They are cast perfectly; a better choice could not have been made. Along with the rest of the cast, including Billy Zane as Rose's wicked fianc√© and Gloria Stuart as Rose at age 101, they allow the audience to join their journey and share in their emotions and experiences. By the conclusion, viewers feel very close to the characters and truly care about them, which is why the movie is so poignant and tragic.So many years after its theatrical release, Titanic still has not lost what made it such a success. This moving, simply beautiful story about fate, disaster, and the power of love has proved to be a timeless classic and an epic masterpiece.",10/10
"Mindless tripe, garbage",Slademan,17 October 1998,"This film is an insult to the intelligence of the common garden slug. The romance between DiCaprio and Winslet is completely unbelievable, with no real chemistry between the two. The script is complete garbage, crafted solely in the believe that the public is as idiotic as the creator of this film. Though the sinking of the ship is well crafted and visually stunning, there is no pity to be felt for the cardboard characters that inhabit this film. The 3 hours or so spent watching this horrible film could be more constructively used watching paint dry. The plot is slipshod and centered not on the tremendous agony and suffering of those soul's lost on the Titanic, but on the self-centered interests of a girl leaving behind her obligation to her family for a 3-day fling with an artist, which is consumated in the back of a car. My hope is that this film is somehow exposed to the people as the massive dung heap that it is. I suggest people who liked this inane, insulting piece of garbage view a film of real emotional power that was also crafted from historical events from the 1910's, ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. I also recommend those who liked this film view the reviews it got from Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who exposes the film's huge weak spots and lack of heart.",1/10
A beautiful recreation,HotToastyRag,6 June 2019,"I have a personal reason for disliking the grand epic Titanic that swept eleven Academy Awards, but for the purposes of this review, I'll remain as impartial as possible. It won't do anyone any good to know that watching this film on the big screen as a child resulted in lifelong hydrophobia.From an artistic standpoint, this movie is flawless. The research and replication of the ill-fated RMS Titanic resulted in an identical duplication. Peter Lamont's production design, Michael Ford's set decoration, and Martin Laing and Charles Lee's art direction is breathtaking. If you spend the entire three hours starting at minute details like dishes, wallpaper, and chandeliers, you'll feel like you're really aboard the ship. The beautiful fashions, designed by Deborah Lynn Scott, are authentic looking and gorgeous. Most of the movie is very beautiful to watch, including the famous dissolve from ruin to reconstruction in the beginning.This wasn't the first movie about the Titanic, and this version's storyline isn't very interesting. Kate Winslet stars as a high-class lady travelling with her mother, Frances Fisher, and her fianc√©, Billy Zane. She meets a low-class American, Leonardo DiCaprio, who won his passage in a card game, and he shows her how to really live and fall in love. Parts of the story are rather weak and feel like they belong in a Disney movie rather than a dramatic epic, but I'm sure the love story will please young-minded teenagers.The beginning of the film recreates finding the remnants of the Titanic at the bottom of the ocean, and a very old woman, Gloria Stuart, tells her memory of the voyage. There are a few cuts back and forth from Gloria's story to the 1912 timeline, but once the iceberg is hit, the rest of the film is shown in real-time, which is an interesting touch and a great feat accomplished by director James Cameron and his co-editors Conrad Buff and Richard A. Harris. However, during the last portion of the film, there are a few flaws that aren't hard to catch, the most obvious being a lack of foam in the seawater. The literally freezing water doesn't make anyone's teeth chatter until they're submerged, but if enclosed in iceberg-infested waters up to one's thighs, symptoms of the cold would absolutely be seen. In a romantic gesture, Kate Winslet is seen trudging her way through the water in her extremely heavy petticoats, but she wouldn't have been able to move so quickly if her legs were being frozen and the weight of her thick dress material were added to the mix.So, depending on your point of view, you can fall in love with this beautiful splendor, full of iconic moments and a memorable theme and song. You can lose yourself in the historical replications or spend your time searching for flaws, which you'll find. I won't ever watch the movie again, but let me know what you think!Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, since there are scary situations that scarred me for life, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",3/10
One Word: OVERRATED,2001Rulz,11 April 1999,"Okay, um, tell me again, what is so good about this movie???????? How did it win best picture next to ""Good Will Hunting?"" Why does everyone obsess over Leonardo DiCaprio?? I didn't even cry at ""Titanic."" Now, I am a girl, but have only seen this movie once. And almost every single one of my friends loves ""Titanic,"" bawled their eyes out at the end, and adores Leonardo DiCaprio & Co. Me? I think ""Armageddon"" is sadder than this movie. (I nearly cried at that one) All I hear is ""Titanic this,"" or ""Titanic that."" I'm sick of it! I have to admit the special effects and set designs are good, but this is just Romeo & Juliet set in 1915. I guess I just didn't ""feel the romance."" I'm not an unemotional person, but I've seen movies a lot more moving (and entertaining) than ""Titanic"". I almost *want* ""The Phantom Menace"" to beat its highest box office gross record. :-) If you haven't seen ""Titanic,"" don't take everyone's word for it if they say it's the greatest movie on earth, okay??

Nice historical reconstruction. Shame they spoilt it with the appalling romantic dross.,jscb,4 February 2000,Not often you see a film where the leading man is prettier than the leading woman.

Cameron Sets a New Standard for 3D Quality,aharmas,4 April 2012,"15 years after this classic first hit, it's back, and now it looks and sounds better than ever, and some recent releases look so muddy and artificial in comparison. Here Cameron uses his expertise to improve on the technical aspects of ""Titanic"" without sacrificing what already worked. Nothing gratuitously calls attention to the new ""3D"" transfer. Instead, it enhances the gorgeous and meticulously produced movie. The spectacle glows with renewed strength, and each performance, each costume, each set now looks remarkable, all contributing what a true cinematic experience should be.As everyone knows, our stars are not reciting Shakespeare. The focus is on the relationship, and how two young people connect with each other. Surrounding them is cast of real and fictional character that gives us a little insight into what it was like being in the doomed ship. People look and act the part. Each class defined by the parameters of their own creation. Cameron understands the passengers on this ride. Zane, Bates, De Caprio and Winslet all do remarkable work, and it's still a question why De Caprio wasn't recognized by his peers when the film first came out. He is central to the success of this confection.In the end, the film, like the title will go on, having us choke on the emotional highs, the times when we understand what gives us humanity and hope, and when we see that humans share so much and are so far from perfect, but we just keep on going, and we will have dreams even after the worst of nightmares.It deserves repeated viewings and much praise. Thank you, Mr. Cameron.",10/10

Monumental drama,fred-houpt,23 March 2007,"Mea Culpa: I had not watched the film till this week. But, I finally sat down and watched it over two nights. I know that Titanic aficionado's will be picking the movie apart for any mistakes and for me that's not important. I don't care enough about the ship and it's history to worry about such matters. I just enjoyed the drama for what it was, even if it was weaving quite a bit of the story out of thin air.The visual impact of the film is very powerful, with the sets giving the viewer the believable impact of watching the real thing, the original ship. The special effects were as good as I've ever seen. Again, the way the ship moved, looked like, flooded, broke apart, all those things looked very real to my eyes.The dramatic love affair is of course the hook that grabs you and it is hard not to be carried away into the sadness without your heart feeling like it has been hurt. It is a very sad story, even if it is made up (I don't know and don't care if it is). There is enough tragedy in the real story of so many people freezing to death in the frigid North Atlantic or drowning for one to feel sad. Just as a drama, I found it very entertaining and emotionally effective. Kate Winslett is gorgeous, sexy and wonderful to watch. I have noticed in almost all the films I've seen with her....that she fills up the screen with a great deal of light. Not only is she beautiful, she exudes youth and energy and in this film she is a delight to behold. Leonardo Di Caprio is wonderful and I have yet to see him in a film that I wasn't captivated. He is, like Johnny Depp, a delight to watch. This is a film with a large cast, especially the many stunt actors, who must have really suffered a lot of hours in cold water. It's a larger than life story and the film delivers. Well worth the 11 Oscars. Excellent and I'm really glad to have finally seen it. A keepsake. This is what blockbusters are supposed to be like.",10/10
One of the Best Movies Ever Made. Haters have no idea.,Movie-ManDan,21 October 2014,"At the time, Titanic was the most expensive and highest-grossing movie of all time. It was also the first movie since Ben-Hur in 1959 to win 11 Oscars, which is the most. Since then, Titanic has become one of the most polar-opposing movies, as well as the second biggest as of now. (Avatar in 2009 is to thank.) The lovers of this movie clearly outnumber the haters because this movie has high ratings on every site. Even so, I still think that it deserves to be ranked higher in every site. Higher than Pulp Fiction or Vertigo? Maybe not, but you get my point. There are flaws in this movie that keep it from being perfect. Number one is the whole subplot with the diamond necklace. Old Rose (who tells the story) still has the diamond and throws it in the ocean at the end because she feels that's where it belongs. Why not give it to a museum? Or feed a country? Then there is Jack and Rose's names being mentioned countless times. Some more dialogue is pretty dumb and there are no instances of any powerful dialogue. But considering how many upsides this movie has, these flaws do almost nothing to effect the quality of the film, because all the positives erase the negatives.The story of Titanic is pretty much Romeo and Juliet on a ship. Jack is a poor, charming artist. Rose is rich and mistreated who gets saved by Jack in every way. Romeo and Juliet is a story that many people find stupid because two young teenagers fall in love, then kill themselves after two days of knowing each other. Yes Jack and Rose fall in love quickly, but there are no dumb suicides, so Jack and Rose are smarter there. People also criticize Rose's character as being a rich, spoiled girl who gets anything she wants. I for one, can relate to Rose's character. She struggles to be perfect and is forced into and world where wealth is number one and is being forced to marry an abusive man who only want to marry her to inherit money. Nobody understands her. She feels trapped. I can relate to Rose's feelings by her becoming what she does not want. Then Jack comes along who finally understands her. He gives her the courage to be what she wants. Jack is sensitive, patient, and fun. Sounds gay? Leo DiCaprio is such a good actor that he makes Jack seem real and cool. This is one of Leo's biggest powerhouse performances that still shines. Maybe Jack and Rose fell in love quickly, but if the ship did not sink, would they have gotten married right away? No. Just date for a few months then break up. If Jack would have lived, would they have gotten married? Maybe. Jack risked his life for Rose, and they did all they could to survive. Since they were part of such a huge impact on each other's lives, maybe they would marry. Maybe not. Not just Jack and Rose, but everybody is developed so well, you feel like you grew up with them. Very few movies feature character development this deep. Then the ship hits the iceberg. Titanic movies have been made that have all turned out well, but none have been spectacular in the sinking portion. The danger is high, sets are great, sympathy is drawn, etc. Then there is the score, which is so beautiful and so sad. It adds so much to the littlest things.People, mainly men, that don't like this think that they're too cool for it. Anybody that doesn't like this just fails at trying to be cool. Too close-minded to see into and beyond a love-story and too close-minded to see how good the song and score were. Maybe this is a fake story, don't try to get all smart and say how the ship really did sink. The acting is extremely strong, characters are developed so well, the disaster scenes are played out excellently, the music is so haunting. Haters should continue watching NASCAR and Delta Force 2. 10/10.",10/10
Certainly an Epic,rlaws-34175,5 November 2023,"It's funny over the years how your views change on things. This movie came out when I was only 16 years old. I saw it with friends in the theatre more times than I'd ever seen any other movie in theaters. We girls even talked the guys into going along all the time. I heard so many different takes on it as well. My aunt was incensed that James Cameron used a fictional couple instead of focusing on all of the amazing stories there were to tell. I understand why he did though. This way he could tell a story that had the true people in it but he was able to manipulate the main characters. I do know that the most amazing story that my Aunt told us that she thought ought to have been in this movie was that of a third class family. They'd had second class tickets on another ship but that ship's crossing was cancelled, and they were given third class tickets on Titanic. The husband was thrilled because third class on Titanic was supposed to be better than second class on the original ship, but his wife worried constantly. People kept declaring the ship ""unsinkable,"" and that to paraphrase, ""no higher power could sink this ship."" She was a woman who believed that it was a very bad idea to tempt Higher Powers, so every night she sat up on the deck and kept watch so that if something happened she could get her family out first thing. The night Titanic hit the iceberg, she saw it and knew Titanic would go down, so she got her family up and in life belts and on deck. She and her children were some of the few third class passengers to get on lifeboats and survive the sinking because she had her family on deck, ready to go, before they locked down third class.Now back to this actual movie, as a 16 year old I loved the romance between Rose and Jack. My Mother, of course, always had to tell me that it was highly unlikely that a young woman of her breeding and a young man of his background would stay in love for long; that it was more of a shipboard romance. Those romances do occur, of course. As I got older and was in my 20's and 30's, I agreed with my Mother. I still loved watching the movie. I love the clothes and I loved to pretend that the romance could happen, that love could conquer all. Now, watching this movie in my early forties, I can see how Rose and Jack's love could have and actually did last, on her part. She never did let go of him. The thing is that Rose was brought up in the wealthy circle but she viewed the people in it as narrow minded. She saw them all as being the same, especially her mother who was selling her to the highest bidder, no matter how he might actually treat Rose. Inside, before she ever met Jack, she already dreamed of the kind of freedom that Jack's life gave him. She was suffocating in the bounds of a society that had rules to control every part of her existence. When she finally really got to know Jack, when they're talking together the day after she almost committed suicide, she sees a freedom in him that she longs to have. In her Jack sees the spirit to take that freedom and run with it if she just will. He sees more than the proper, docile young lady. He sees in her what no one else does. He sees the rebellious side that matches his own rebellious side. The side they both have to disregard convention. When she goes down to third class with Jack to the party they have down there, she has more fun than she's probably had in her whole, suppressed life. For once she gets to let loose and be a 17 year old young woman. She gets to just have real fun, not suppressed ""fun."" I can again see how the romance between them works and it's obvious that she truly does want that kind of life because instead of finding her mother and Cal on the Carpathia after Jack is dead, she hides out in steerage, gives her name as Rose Dawson, and proceeds to do all of the things she and Jack talked about doing and more. She earns her own way, she rides in the surf side saddle, she learns to fly a plane, she acts, and eventually she even gets married and has children and grandchildren; a family who loved her, just as Jack wanted her to and just as they would have done together if he'd lived. She didn't NEED the money and the high society that her mother was so desperate to cling to. For years I wondered why she didn't give Mr. Lovett the Heart of the Ocean at the end but I think part has to do with the fact that she'd finally gotten all these people who had so little respect for what happened (note Mr. Bodine's comment, ""Oops, someone left the water running,"") to truly SEE and I'm not sure she wanted to undo that but more importantly, the diamond was a burden to her. It was a reminder of a cruel man and a selfish mother. It was a piece of bondage. But she couldn't just get rid of it because it was too well known. People would have begun to realize that Rose had not died on the Titanic. When she finally did throw it overboard right over Titanic, she breathed a huge sigh of relief, like a big burden had just been lifted. I think, even more than my first theory, that's the one that works. She needed to be rid of the burden.The disaster part of it was, of course, exceedingly well done. I admit, after reading several first hand accounts of the sinking, and all of the survivors reported the same thing, they did NOT see Titanic break in two pieces. They simply saw it go down in such a way that it was eventually standing up vertically, before sinking under the water completely. I initially attributed this to the tumult of the night and the trauma they went through. James Cameron and others had come up with the way he showed the ship sink because of how far apart the two sections were on the ocean floor. Now I've seen his 20th anniversary documentary and he does a lot of research into how the Titanic really went down and finally came to the conclusion that it did, in fact, go down in one piece and it broke in two once it was completely under water. My Mom was always surprised that my Dad liked to watch Titanic with her. It turns out that they liked different parts of the movie. She loved the beautiful clothes and the beautiful sets and all of that from the first part of the movie. Dad loved watching the disaster part because it was very well done. He was always sad at the lives that were lost but he separated himself from that reality and watched a well done disaster movie. The one thing that does annoy me is that James Cameron didn't let Molly Brown be the woman she really was. She didn't just sit meekly down in her lifeboat and stay there. After a little while she got back up and threatened to throw the crewman overboard if he didn't go back for survivors. She IS called ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" for a reason and not just because of a somewhat fictionalized Debbie Reynolds movie.It is true that the first class men did try to help get the women into boats. I read the book written by Colonel Archibald Gracie right after the sinking. He helped with others to do this. When JJ Astor asked permission to accompany his pregnant wife and was told, ""no,"" He accepted that gracefully and helped get people in the boats as well. Madeline Astor, who may or may not have had more than her fur stole since many didn't dress warmly enough because they didn't believe the ship was sinking, gave her stole to a THIRD class woman (almost unthinkable in those times) so the woman could keep her little boy Filly warm. Madeline was, herself, five months pregnant and probably cold, but she didn't want the little guy to be cold. Colonel Gracie helped get women and children off the ship, then he went and helped cut down the submersibles. They were able to get two boats right side up but not the other two they were working on. As Titanic went farther down, he and several men, held onto the bottom of one of the submersibles that they hadn't been able to get right side up. Many people tried to get on and they allowed as many as they could until the thing began to have trouble staying afloat. Those in the water mostly accepted this and swam away. After waiting for the life boats to come back only Colonel Gracie and Lighttoller were still alive. He died eight months later from complications of hypothermia and diabetes. His last words were, ""Get them in the boats. Get them in the boats.""
Most of us, I think, know about the Strauss's and how Mrs. Strauss declared that she'd been with her husband for fifty years and she wasn't going to leave him now.I suppose part of what I'm trying to get at is that there are so many remarkable stories from the real Titanic that no matter which way James Cameron went, he'd be criticized. If he told some of the stories and not all, the descendants of those left out would've been hurt and angry. He didn't have time to tell ALL of those amazing stories. He only had time to tell some things and the sinking does take up as much as the love story. The Titanic hits the iceberg at about 1 hour 38 minutes out of a 3 hour 15 minute film.I saw another version of Titanic that was made for TV a year before this one came out. They tried to put more of the real passengers in there but it didn't work. They made Colonel Gracie look like a buffoon. The only child, Lorraine, from first class who died, died because her mother couldn't find her baby boy and she wouldn't get on a lifeboat without him. Her baby was already on a boat with his nurse. It was miscommunication. But the movie mixed the nurse up with another woman of the same name who had drowned her own baby. That woman's family were furious. Thing is even if Cameron had tried to just do real stories he'd still be in trouble with family members.Try Julian Fellowes's mini series. It's fascinating, telling the story through all walks of life. I don't know how many of those people were real but some certainly were.Titanic 1997, is a great movie. They needed to show the chaos too because that's why ships have safety drills now. And chaos reigned in the end.",10/10

Who doesn't love a good-looking romance?,archienina99,28 March 2007,"I have a great value for James Cameron's Titanic.The characters are all so glossily two-dimensional and beautifully clich√©. The emotional and mental growth of the characters so splendidly predictable. And most of the lower-class folk were the healthiest and best looking I'd ever seen.It's a nostalgic return to the old days of Hollywood, when it was clear who the goodies were and who the baddies were, and when everyone had perfect teeth.Bit like a modern Casablanca...except it's in colour...and takes 90 minutes longer, and...er... is considerably less witty...but still, I have a great value for it.Yes, yes, it's true that I dozed off and on, off and on, watching it the first time at the cinema. But I must point out that I was feeling particularly tired that day, and it had nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that sleeping through it in ten-minute blocks made no difference to my ability to work out what was going on. Indeed, when I caught the whole of it on TV another time with my friend, who had tried everything else to get her baby to sleep, I truly gained an appreciation of its value.",4/10
Very Entertaining,claudonio,20 January 2000,"Though ""Titanic"" didn't deserve to win best picture it is still a very well done movie that will entertain anyone who watches it. The visual effects in this film are astounding and absolutely beleivable. Alot of people say this film is overrated but I dissagree. Like I said not the best film ever but entertaining anyways. James Cameron is a masterful director and I hope he announces his next movie soon. ""Terminator 2"" still ranks as his best film though.",10/10
"It's Good, But Come On Everyone Went Overboard.",Chubbs-2,1 September 1999,"Now, this movie made over 1 Billion dollars, and I'm happy to say that not a single one of those dollars were mine. I have seen it, but I saw it at a company preview, and I work at a video store, so free videos. Now, don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie, but the hype that went on over it and the out pour of praise for Leonardo DiCaprio, from fans that came out of the wood work, who really didn't appreciate Leo's previous and better work, such as This Boy's Life and The Basketball Diaries, now they were good movies.Everyone was urged to see this movie, it was almost uncool not to have seen. If someone had asked you if you had seen it and you answered no, they thought you were crazy. Well I decided to make a stand against it. This movie was pure Hollywood, no real story, it was pretty obvious what was going to happen with the love story, and I can't believe it made so much money, I mean everyone knew the ending............It sank.If you are to watch it, make sure you watch an original copy with surround sound, or better yet see it on DVD.

"A true classic-The ""GWTW"" of disaster movies",mike48128,21 March 2016,"Best version since the old ""A Night to Remember"" (1953). With all those reviews, I only need to ""touch"" on the synopsis of the film. 101 year-old ""Rose"", long thought to have died in the disaster, reappears as the wreck is examined and it's contents rescued yet again. The ""explorer-scavenger"" is fascinated both with the story and romance of it all, but especially the recovery of the romantic 58 Caret heart-shaped diamond necklace known as ""The Heart of the Sea"" which is worth more than the Hope Diamond. Did such a gem exist, or is it the product of the screenwriter's vivid imagination? It is a well-told tale and the time passes so fast that it doesn't seem like a 3 hour movie at all. Superb cinematography combined with seamlessly beautiful special effects and the best shipwreck ever filmed. Models and the CGI are most convincing. The Oscar-winning musical score and audio are amazing. The ships motors and interior looks entirely authentic. Kathy Bates has a wonderful ""minor"" role as the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown, and, as MGM used to say, ""a cast of ""more stars than there are in Heaven"". Billy Zane plays the deliciously mean and arrogant fianc√©e of 17-year-old ""Rose"",who is being forced to have pre-nupual sex, and marry a man she does not love, for his money. She hates it and is almost driven to suicide. One nude scene of a beautiful woman-child will offend only a minority of the viewing audience. (Rated PG-13. Also a few choice swear words.) Best ending ever (warning-huge spoiler) as ""Rose"" slips the huge blue diamond into the sea. The original DVD is letterboxed and not ""anamorphic"". Buy a later version, which is remastered for 16x9 TV. It is remastered to 1.78 format. I like to stop it around chapter 18 for an ""intermission"". I also highly recommend seeing ""Titanic-The Artifact Exhibit"" as a roadshow or Las Vegas attraction.",10/10
Masterpiece,pijushsr,13 September 2023,Emotional. Can't forget any moment. Love of Jack and Rose touch my heart. Every moment of this movie is so attractable that I can not write. A very happen inning movie. Lovely scene of ship and ocean. A journey that can never forget. A real history but describe present very beautifully. Rich and poor lifestyle is shown and the difference can be shown at every moment. The director is successful in showing lovely look of Rose and the eyes of rose can easily say love for Jack. A great sacrifice for love by giving own life. What more a movie lover need. Finally the Titanic movie is nothing but a altime masterpice.,10/10
An Epic Scale,raysond,8 September 2004,"Released around the Christmas season of 1997,this was an epic scale of a motion picture event. Director James Cameron's three hour mega-budget picture has its brushes with disaster with a mammoth budget(which at the time this picture was made,it took two years to make and was the most expensive movie ever made at $285 million,the most costliest movie to date)and a theatrical release that seemed unattainable. But instead of reaping hordes of criticism for what many have thought was one of the biggest joke in Hollywood,Cameron received accumlated praise and a boatload of Oscar hardware for his labor of love,which rack up the Academy Awards with 11 Oscars including Best Picture,and has tied the record with ""Ben Hur"",and most recently the Lord Of The Rings final installment to the trilogy,""The Return Of The King"",as the most record number of Oscars to be presented in Hollywood.This was indeed,""Gone With The Wind"" on an epic scale.This was in fact a grand love story that happens to have the sinking of an historic ship as a backdrop,real characters and fictional characters are blended for a detailed re-enactment of the luxury liner's first and last voyage. The main characters,two lovebirds Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCaprio),and debutante Rose Bukater(Kate Winslet)are from different ends of the economic and social ladder. DiCaprio and Winslet are dynamic as the star-crossed lovers and make the running time of 198 minutes less a chore to sit through. The special effects are impressive with a life sized version of the ship just built for the film. Cameron's prowess as a storyteller keeps the outcome of the ship suspenseful and tense even though the ending is no secret. The film contains an all-star cast including Billy Zane,Bill Paxton,Kathy Bates,Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart(in her final film role),Jonathan Hyde-White,Danny Nicci, Bernard Hill,Victor Garber,Bernard Fox,Suzy Amis,and David Warner.The film has won numerous awards since its release and in 1997,it was the first film to win both the MTV Awards,Golden Globes and Oscars in that same year,not to mention Best Musical Score from composer James Horner and Best Song of that year,""My Heart Will Go On"" sung by Celine Dion. Also to point,during its release,""Titanic"" went on to break box office records,and it did just that but dethroning the all-time box office champ,""Star Wars"",not to mention other box-office records as well including ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"",""ET"",and others at the time of its release,since then that record has been shattered by the most recent ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy and the ""Harry Potter"" series.Released by two major Hollywood studios,Paramount Pictures and Twentieth Century-Fox,the film itself has become one of the spectacular Hollywood greats.

Not as bad as I expected - but still none too brilliant,yulie-2,28 July 2000,"Well, I'm not going to completely bash this movie. For what it's worth, it's decent entertainment, moves along at a fairly good pace - impressive, considering this is a three hour flick - and Kate and Leo were okay (though both can do much better). I expected worse, knowing it had been horribly over-hyped and that James Cameron was evil (one can argue about how evil). Also, the sets and Kate's dresses were very pretty. That's about it for the positives. The story is shallow and full of holes, most of the dialog is plain silly, and the whole movie is, basically, spectacular kitsch. I honestly think Titanic is probably one of the least deserving Academy Award winners ever - and in the same year as LA Confidential, Good Will Hunting, and even The Full Monty. Unbelievable.",6/10
Mesmerising Beauty,alikhalidduke,17 March 2022,I want to watch this movie everyday.

God Bless her.,10/10
A timeless masterpiece that is also an unforgettable movie experience,hassan-ilahi,27 March 2011,"I am breathless and out of words for THIS film. No, its not the best film I've seen, but it certainly comes close to being. James Cameron is a true genius and he's the person to thank.Titanic is a wholesome tragedy adapted from the historic event when more 1000 people lost their lives. This film is pure art and will never be forgotten. It is filled with extravaganza effects, worthy performances, and a simply adorable soundtrack.Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances in his career. He is simply perfect as Jack; simple, yet humanized. Kate Winslet is even better, playing Rose with Gratitude, courage, and efficiency. This is also, simply her best performance in her career.Effects are simply breathtaking. James Cameron provides with stuff that you would have never seen in the 90s. As for his direction, also benefits because of his stretchy camera angles and glorious sights. This is seriously Cameron at his BEST and there's nothing more wonderful than that.Small things like soundtracks don't usually matter in films, but this film has the best I have heard in my life! Racy, touching, and emotional; there isn't anything like it.Overall, I have no words for Titanic. Almost everything is near-perfect in this timeless classic. It is also an unforgettable cinematic experience; as well as a benchmark in history for visual effects. James Cameron has got the big job done and has succeeded thoroughly.'Go see it now, because you certainly won't be disappointed one bit with this film'",10/10
Masterpiece underrated,Igor_Husak,2 September 2007,"I saw this movie few hours ago and I can't help asking myself same question: ""Why is it so poorly rated?""IMDb is the best movie site I ever saw and I noticed when it comes to ratings it's surprisingly how users ratings work good for me. In 95% cases rating over 7 means that the movie is worth watching. For me Titanic is without any doubt classic. It was brilliant film when I saw it 10 years ago and it didn't loose any of its quality when I saw it moments ago. Why is it so I don't intent to write because I thing many reviews here did that already. Shortly, lets just say that it was directed perfectly by visionary James Cameron in the way that 3 hours long epic film doesn't get boring, characters are played excellent by many talented actors (in that moment Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet were relatively unknown), story is also great and connects love story and Titanic's fate beautifully, special effects are impressive even today and Hans Zimmer did amazing job with music. When I saw Titanic was rated 6.9 I was stunned, it should be rated over 8 at least. Why is it so? Well, few years after Titanic's release it became very popular to spit on it without good reason so it probably got even to peoples minds.I guess even peoples opinions can be manipulated. It's just sad it affected this truly wonderful movie.Evergreen 10/10",10/10
"""You're gonna need a bigger boat"". (see Jaws infra)",ween-3,24 December 2000,"It's almost too easy to bash this film. So I'll just paraphrase what James Cameron himself said on TV one night about the ""pitch"" meeting for the film...""I got an idea for a film about a boat. It's about 3 hours long and nothing much is gonna happen for about 2 1/2 hours. Then everbody dies and there's no chance for a sequel. And by the way..it's gonna cost you about $200 million to make it. Whaddya think, guys?""Truth be told..the first half hour or so (the Bill Pullman stuff with actual footage) ain't bad, but nothing I haven't already seen on the Discovery Channel. I'll still take Cameron's ""The Abyss"" every day and twice on Sunday. The guy directs a pretty neat little action film. It's just that I like my disposable love stories served with a side order of humor..and maybe some actual ""acting"". You know. The stuff that actors do in movies? In ""The Abyss"", Ed Harris and the gang got into their characters enough to give the movie a nice kick. Leo and Co. are reduced to playing second fiddle to blue screen effects.And here's another shining moment for the Oscars. Ranks right up there with the Milli Vanilli Grammy Award in the ""What the hell were they thinking, anyway?"" category.",7/10
The ultimate motion picture. The ultimate love story. Grandiose effects. Cinema to melt away. Unrivaled.,Luleo_23,14 April 2023,"After 25 years, one sees things more realistically, less one-dimensionally in the retrospective. What has been achieved here in terms of film history and music is beyond question: it is almost a moon landing of cinema history.

Whether feature films or documentaries, they were all recorded.This film is without a doubt a masterpiece! A groundbreaking masterpiece. It amazed people so much back then!This soundtrack that blends perfectly with the scenes ""Goosebumps and tears in the eyes moments"" The powerful visuals of the ship and the sunset - always perfectly captured!The last half hour is a ""tear-jerker of emotions"", so emotional, so tragic, so soulful.The film is so multi-faceted! Cameron manages to bring the small different plots into a context and generate a big whole out of it - this makes the film not boring for a second!

It's the little things,decoyb4u-3,11 June 1999,"I was just wandering the city one day, seeing the city lights, so I went to see it. Titanic. The big movie, that everybody went and talked about.I'll go straight to the point and won't go as to say anything about the plot. We've all gotten that in by force I think. What I find good about this movie are the small things. Not where everything is focused upon: Decaprio and Kate obviously. The movie has much personality, so love it or hate it; you'll find something about Titanic that feels personal. I won't let out what I think was my favorite part of the movie.Titanic is, yes, a good movie. I would be blind if I didn't see the beauty of this movie. But, maybe Titanic is too much larger then life. When watching it, you fail to remember reality. It all seems all too Hollywood, with Decaprio's face on the dollar bill with Titanic in the background.Titanic tells us about every living thing on the ship (or so it seems) even the rats get a little spotlight in. But the whole thing seems still to evolve just two characters. So, it seems to me that the movie gets too shallow: Sinking a ship just to get a good love story? Ah well, maybe I'm too picky? Titanic is good though. Guess where my favorite part of the movie is? You'll never guess it. I'll give you a clue. Somewhere along the sinking scene. :) Enjoy the movie.",No Rating
So the ship sinks;so what?,roland-27,27 July 1999,"My initial thoughts when first sitting down to watch Titanic at the cinema were,""So we already know the ending, so how good can it be?""Well, after the first ten minutes of crap, the true story unfolds and the story of Rose(Kate Winslet) and Jack(Leonardo Di Caprio) is told.Titanic has an all star cast including the afore mentioned doomed lovers, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates(Misery), Bill Paxton(A Simple Plan) and Jonathon Hyde(Anaconda). Each of the cast puts in a near perfect performance, and the story is surprisingly good. Both Winslet and Di Caprio deserved more recognition for their stunning performances as did James Cameron for his brilliant direction.On a whole, the film was an excellent version of the Titanic tragedy.

You see the hopefulness in every one when boarding, not knowing what awaits ahead. And you see the tragic horrors unfold as the Titanic sunk. Cameron portrayed the human condition when everyone fights to survive and the social differences very well.Considering this is a 1997 film, it's still better than a lot of new films today, both story-wise and special effects wise.",10/10

Great Movie,tatdenning,20 February 2022,"I remember seeing this when it came out in the theater. My friends went before me because I thought it sounded over-hyped, but they loved it so much that they convinced me to go. And I was not disappointed.This is a wonderful movie and such a really well-written story. I love that they tell the story of the Titanic from this very personal angle, because it really makes it hit home that the people on this ship were just like you and me (well, maybe those in the steerage class in my case lol).I also think it was so smart to tell it from the vantage point of Rose, now in her old age, reflecting back to her younger years, and the great, but brief, love that she lost. It really helps draw you into the story, and just when you're glued to the screen, it changes back to the other era to add more to the story.This in another one of those movies that I can watch over and over again.

TITANIC has become one of my favorite films of the 90's.,vip_ebriega,24 February 2007,"My Take: An indisputably sweeping epic. A future classic? It should be.(This is an extension of the review I wrote in February 2007)Every so often, a magnificent epic would just take you away from all that and just sweep you by your feet. James Cameron's unbeatable, $200 million TITANIC is exactly that film, so it just upsets me why some people still don't get it.I was just wondering, it compelled me more than any other film I've seen for quite awhile (not to mention, it won 11 awards in the Oscars and scored high in the box-office), but why some people try to act cynical and bash this wonderful motion picture (This film is rated 7/10 here on IMDb? Come on!). ""Titanic"" is really that rare kind of masterpiece we don't usually find in today's film era. It wasn't just a big-budgeted film, it was a truly dramatic and touching tale with an old-fashioned romance that movies like CASABLANCA revolutionized. If movies like that are classics in a way TITANIC wanted to revisit, then may I ask what's wrong? The cast, headed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are superb. The direction and writing job by James Cameron is terrific (So is he just getting a hang of the love story thing? I think not!). But one of the real highlights is the superb score by James Horner, and the magnificent theme song. It has become one of my favorite all-time songs. The film too, has become one of my all-time favorites. Not only that, the film is also accurate on some of the facts. James Cameron really made sure to make it as realistic as possible. Like the sinking of the Titanic. Cameron really made that realistic (about the ship splitting in half before sinking). Anyway, combining such elements make it such a winner that won't insult you.I'm sure the movie is not without its imperfections, but when a movie's too good to be true, such elements don't come to you. It never did throughout the immense but utterly sweeping 194 minutes. It's entertainment at its best.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10/10
Revisiting the classic Titanic,lidefei,16 March 2023,"In the past, I was unable to comprehend Jack; I always assumed that he was a romantic lad with liberal ideas who enjoyed leading an unrestrained life. The maxim ""To make each day count"" appealed to me because I desired adventure and independence. There is no purpose in focusing only on love because life is harsh and not a haven for those looking for pleasure. Thinking back on the entire movie, Jack's words and deeds eventually made it clear to me that he is the one who knows the most about love and life. He was the one who taught Rose how to love and live her life to the fullest. In addition to being Rose's lover, Jack Dawson served as her spiritual supporter. He cared for her until she was grey and helped her recall when she was unable to walk anymore: ""There was a man named Jack Dawson, and that he saved me in every way that a person can be saved.""",9/10

On board the Titanic, she meets Jack (Leonardo di Caprio), who teaches her to be ""free"", or in other words, be trashy and self-centered. The movie is filled with bad acting and even worse writing.

Worst Movie of 1997,emfern13,7 December 2001,This movie is complete rubbish. It is two hours too long and it has terrible acting in it.

Cameron's MASTERPIECE!,the-gossip-king,20 December 2009,"For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Rose's and Jack's story alone, no one else. Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home. The music has become iconic and legendary. It is composer James Horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience. The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is. Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime. My heart won't go on from this one.",10/10
One of my all time favourite movies!,munruh-41956,30 September 2023,"The film Titanic(1997) written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron is an epic cinematic masterpiece, that unfolds a captivating narrative of the fateful ship of dreams. It revolves around the heartwarming love story between a young man (Jack) and a woman (Rose), whose passionate bond is disrupted by the clear boundaries of social class. Just as their emotional connection reaches its top, the ship encounters a catastrophic destiny. The sinking ship drives Jack and Rose to struggle for survival in the middle of chaos, ultimately encountering deeply distressing trials.This film has to be one of my all-time favourites. Watching Titanic has never gotten boring to me; even after watching the film several times. The film's set design, both inside and out, immerses you in the Titanic's magnificence. The authenticity is noticeable, drawing you in completely. When the disaster unfolds, Cameron grabs hold of you, pulling you through every painful moment with careful detail.Cameron accomplishes keeping the performance from diverting our focus from the sad reality. Watching the Titanic's destruction isn't enjoyable, or exhilarating, it's deeply painful. Different from typical disaster films, it never feels like we're just watching extras on a set, each person on screen feels like a developed character. The lead-up to the iceberg collision compels you convincingly within the period, giving every character a sense of authenticity. As the ship starts to sink, the shock of seeing the characters disappear is greatly impactful. Throughout much of the sinking, the fictional circumstances of Jack and Rose take a step back, allowing viewers to think about the reality and empathize with the terror of being aboard the ship on that night.The movie presents the love, bravery, and courage that occurred on that fateful evening, illustrating the sinking of the ship and the tragic loss of more than a thousand lives. I would recommend this movie to viewers as young as 13 or 14 as it does have some suggestive matter. Overall Titanic offers many elements. It's a romance, disaster film, an action-packed adventure, filled with humour, and a tragic tale.",10/10
Excellent: 9.5,StonedMagician,27 July 2019,"So many romance movies come out these days, and so many of them have characters, stories, and relationships that are hopelessly difficult to care about. Who could have guessed that James Cameron, known for highly visual works like Terminator and Aliens, would create what is in my mind unquestionably one of the greatest love stories ever? If I had gone into Titanic blind, I certainly wouldn't have. I will get the few real flaws out of the way first. Leonardo DiCaprio, as great as he is in this film, is forced to yell commands to Rose a bit too much. And the 3D is a gimmick, nothing more. However, to my knowledge, this is the only way to experience this film in IMAX, so for me at least, wearing the glasses was well worth it. Though I'm sure I am overlooking some, that's about it for the bad. On to the good. Firstly, I hope that the rerelease of this acclaimed film will remind directors of romantically-minded movies everywhere of how to do it right. James Cameron starts the film in the present day (or at least, it was when it was released), with an expedition to the titular wreck overseen by an enthusiastic explorer (Bill Paxton). He finds a bunch of papers in a safe on the ship, and restores a drawing of a young woman naked, wearing only a necklace. This sets into motion a series of events leading to a three hour long flashback detailing Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet, played in the ""present"" by Gloria Stuart), and her passionate relationship with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). I could type for hours about how well-acted, emotional, and real this pair seems. I won't, but suffice it to say that all acting awards were well-deserved. For the bare majority of the film, Jack and Rose are in the spotlight. The length of the film actually works to its advantage, because ample time is given to see how their relationship springs, wilts, and ultimately blossoms. Jack is a lower-class man, and even he makes no bones about it. Rose is from the opposite end of the spectrum, and hates it. Jack finds he about to commit suicide over her marriage forced on her by her mother. The moments the two share really sell their relationship, enough so that the audience becomes invested as well. Class differences are an extremely prominent issue, brought up again and again. At one point, Rose reminds a frantic crewman that only half the ship's population can fit on the lifeboats. Her husband-to-be overhears this, and replies ""the better half."" The rich are not painted in a sympathetic light. They are arrogant, selfish, and terrible people that throw others off just to have themselves a little more space. Cameron goes this extra mile to ensure that we are sympathetic with Rose. She is forced to walk among these horrid humans, and finally, stumbles upon someone that treats her as an equal, and in an almost husband-like manner, as opposed to her stuck-up, borderline misogynistic fiancee. After almost two hours of engaging, superb relationship-building, the inevitable iceberg looms. This, of course, is where James Cameron's signature technical brilliance kicks in in full force. Metal is torn asunder, flooding commences everywhere, and there are many grand exterior shots showing the Titanic going down. All of which are done with excellent special effects that look as real as any of the characters in the midst of them. This is also where the movie becomes incredibly, brutally honest about what probably happened once the ship began to sink. Hundreds are shown drowning and falling, including children. The rich shun the poor, literally kicking them off lifeboats. SOS signals are sent, and fireworks are launched. And, in what could be the greatest scene in the film, four string instrument players lament the catastrophe the only way they know how. And through it all, Rose and Jack find each other through the worst of it, and stay alive until the last possible moment. James Cameron's work in this film is truly extraordinary. He is not known for crafting compelling characters or stories. However, in these respects, he succeeds brilliantly here. In modern romance films, characters and their tribulations are about as genuine as cardboard cutouts. Cameron has created a set, populated it with characters that fill it to the last inch, and bound it all together with great attention to artistic and technical detail. I left trying to sort out what I liked most about it. I haven't yet decided, but I knew then and know now that I have seen a beautiful masterpiece from the unlikeliest of sources.",9/10
An excellent movie,freaky_dave,13 January 2006,"I know there are some out there who snicker at this movie when it is mentioned, yet if so many people hated it, why is it the biggest selling movie of all time in America. It sold more than Star Wars, and George Lucas released that movie more than once. I found this shocking, but it happened. Ticket sales don't lie, and for those who laugh at this movie now, they are probably some of the same ones that saw it in the theater. Hypocrites.My own experience with Titanic was a good one and yes I am a guy. I enjoyed the back story that followed before the sinking, and this is probably Cameron's best film to date. Yes it's even better than the first two Terminator films and Aliens, and they are all movies that I appreciated.Many didn't like this film because of Leonardo DiCaprio. Yes he's given better acting performances in other movies (What's Eating Gilbert Grape), but in Titantic he was still very good. Of course I don't think people dislike DiCaprio because of his acting. They just don't like him for some reason. Yet I never heard anything bad about him before Titanic made him a mega superstar.In my opinion, Titanic is a great film. It was one of the best in 1997 and was still popular in the summer of 1998 when it was still being shown in the theaters. That alone is a fantastic achievement. So all you hypocrites can laugh all you want. The fact is that this movie is still well liked by many, and is still the biggest selling movie of all time in 2006. Update, very late I know. Avatar surpassed this movie in sales directed by who else, James Cameron again. Incredible.",10/10
Grossly over rated,CabbageCustard,17 December 2019,"I avoided watching this movie for years and years, despite the entreaties of friends who insisted I would love it. Finally, many years after this was released, I capitulated and watched it with a friend. It was as bad as I had suspected. Overrated, predictable, overly sentimental and dull. I can't work out why so many people love it. It's a Hallmark movie on steroids.",4/10
An Odd Film in the James Cameron Canon,gavin6942,11 May 2015,"A seventeen-year-old aristocrat (Kate Winslet), expecting to be married to a rich claimant (Billy Zane) by her mother, falls in love with a kind but poor artist (Leonardo DiCaprio) aboard the luxurious, ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic.The first thing that is really striking about this film is that it came from James Cameron, who is much better known for science fiction films like ""Terminator"", ""Avatar"" and ""Aliens"". He is not the first person that comes to mind when you think of historical fiction romances. And yet, he nailed it. ""Titanic"", despite its length of three hours, was a huge success and may have sold more VHS copies than any other movie.But beyond the romance, this is actually a rather decent movie. I cannot say why, it is something hard to put one's finger on. Most likely, it has something to do with Billy Zane, who is more or less the greatest thing about the film.",7/10
Big & Empty,Hotoil,18 March 2001,"I have always been fascinated by the story of the Titanic, and I had high hopes for this film.  Unfortunately, what I got was a cold, mindless Hollywood romance flick that merely used the Titanic as a springboard to emptier things.I found it less than moving.  The romantic storyline was nothing new at all, and the acting and dialogue was generally laughable.  What did work?  It has lots of pretty faces, elaborate set-design and special effects, plus looks and feels 'epic' (with no substance to back it up).Just a big, empty romance-disaster movie here.  If your interested in the story of the Titanic, read about it in books, there is little here we don't already know and the focus is mainly on the characters, who are no more than one-dimensional stereotypes.",No Rating
romantic,sherlock-CC,22 June 2020,"In the context of the biggest shipwreck, the poignant love story is the main line of the movie, which is extremely sensational. The story is based on the search for ""the heart of the ocean"", using the narration of a shipwrecked surviving old man Ruth as an introduction, and using flashbacks to introduce the audience to a mood of involuntary role replacement. The characters who follow the story look as if they were there.",9/10
"Very grand, very entertaining, and very frightening",tracywinters-44332,29 November 2017,"I don't understand all the bad reviews here. I'm not given to getting syrupy over romance films, but this one actually was pretty good.A telling of the true story of the sinking of the ship Titanic, but this movie is first and foremost a romance movie. Kate Winslet is beautiful, and though they could have cast a better male lead, Leo DiCaprio is not too bad.The real star of this film is the sinking ship sequence. It is quite realistic and the cold weather and fright of that night back in 1912 is at least partly captured --- it must have been a terrible event for the poor souls on board that vessel. The moment that was most poignant to me was when Captain Smith went back to his bridge and realized the ocean was about to break through his giant windows.Recommended for all who love a good romance film.",9/10
This film is a bit like Marmite!,gaiter88,22 April 2005,"So you either love it or you hate it, I personally fall in to the hate camp. However I do feel that may be hate is perhaps too a strong a word to be using (it really should be reserved for the likes of Michael Schumacher and Roy Keane!).The down fall of Titanic is it success really, because if it hadn't been so big no one would really care about it, and more importantly those of us who didn't like it wouldn't feel so angry and aggrieved that it made soooo much money! If you ignore all the hype and just look at the film a clearer picture emerges. As a piece of history telling it is not all that great, it is much too involved in its lead characters for that, and if you want to know more about the event of the Titanic sinking you'd be far better off watching A Night to Remember. What Titanic really is, is a romantic drama. On this front it is not too bad, slightly too sugary for me (and I expect most serious cinema goers) but for those who just want to be charmed and 'loved up' it is fine, Leo and Winslet do a reasonable job, and the story is reasonable believable and interesting.So why, you may well ask, have I given it a rating of 2? The answer to this is simple. I love films, and I like to think although I have certain tastes and favourites I do appreciated a good film when I see it. Titanic is mediocre to reasonable at best, but when it was released it seemed to manage to brainwash the nation, and in fact whole world, into thinking it was the best thing since sliced bread. I had friends arguing its 'greatness' at me, and at the time (and still now) all I could do was feel sorry for them for having such a bad understanding and knowledge of films to think Titanic was at the top of the tree.On top of this I really felt aggrieved at the amount of money it had commanded in cost and sales. Money which may well have made handfuls of marvellous smaller films, but much more importantly could have gone someway to solving the problems within this world instead of lining the studies pockets! And so help me god if I ever have to hear that awful song again!",3/10
Why is it 3 hours and 15 minutes long?,moejoedajoejoe,19 September 2022,"The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most well-remembered tragedies in western history, almost as well-remembered as this movie. I wonder who thought that the best way to portray such a tragedy was to overshadow it with 3 hours of soap opera level melodrama. I want the half of my life this film took back. Even young Kate Winslet getting her tits out in a PG-13 rated film can't make up for how long this trash drags on. Pearl Harbor gets absolutely clowned (deservedly so) for overshadowing the titular event with hours of unrelated melodrama, this film deserves all of the same criticism and more. You're here for 20 minutes of a 3 hour and 15 minute movie. The level of idiocy required to appreciate this film, and its lack of respect for your time and the topic it should be covering, is simply titanic.",1/10
Gargantuan,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,13 March 2010,"Yes, for a long time, I did avoid this one. Eventually, I realized that I had to; Cameron is talented enough to make this work. I've now seen every film he's directed, save for Piranha Part II(which I understand was taken away from him), and the man always does a nice job. No, not every single picture of his is excellent... but they're all worth the time(and with hardly any exceptions(and this certainly isn't one), the investment of emotions from the audience, as well), they entertain and he's yet to make the exact same thing twice(Terminator 2 is different from the original in notable areas, such as the tone). I don't blindly love all of them; I maintain that the quality of The Abyss lies mainly in the gorgeous under-water photography. He never phones it in, and he always has something to say, somewhere to go with what he does. I was apprehensive of the idea that this would focus on a small group of people(in particular, the two leads), when this was indeed something that actually did happen, and many were killed. However, when you think about it, it needed to be like that; that's what makes the incident(in this) have the devastating impact that I think we can all admit it does. Yes, the FX are amazing, and the production values offer a new definition of the term ""grandiose"" when applied to that aspect; the reason we ""feel"" it, though, is that we care about the ones we ""know"" to be on the ship. The characters are well-written, thoroughly developed, credible and all have something to do. Rose is a rather strong woman, and without it reaching anachronistic levels, either. She is not ""just a wife"", and she is fleshed out, something that many attempts at female role models neglect to do. The cast is spot-on, everyone is well-chosen. Every single acting performance is flawless. Arguably, this is somewhat black and white in its presentation of them; with that said, they are all convincing and have genuine personality. This is one of the greatest disaster movies, and epic love dramas, in the world of cinema. It is Hollywood and mainstream at its absolute best. Will it please everyone? Perhaps not, and probably not those who refuse to take it on its own terms. It was always clear what approach this took. And also, about hype... ignore it. Yes, you read that right. In this case and in all others, pretend like you can't hear what everyone is making something out to be, and watch what you feel like, as unaffected by popular opinion as you can be. Nothing can survive a viewing by someone who has heard nothing other than positives about it, regardless of its quality. The pacing is marvelous; for a running time of three hours, this is not boring at all. It has fun and humorous moments. Is it sappy? I suppose that's up to the individual to judge; I wouldn't say so. There is a bit of violence and disturbing content, infrequent mild to moderate language, a little sexuality(hinted at) and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to everyone. 10/10",10/10

For all the awards this trash did win, nobody with any clout gave the actors anything. Leo didn't even get a nomination! The ship sank, and people died because a big company traded lives for profit.

"""Love in a cold climate""?,",benbrae76,11 September 2006,"Such a lot of care was taken, so I'm told, with most aspects of the accuracy of this movie. If that is so, I cannot understand why one of the most important facts is glaringly wrong, and that is the name of the ship. It was not the SS Titanic, but the RMS Titanic, i.e. The Royal Mail Ship Titanic.I could be wrong, but I think it must be taken with a pinch of salt that the sketch left in the safe could have really been in such pristine condition after 80 years at the bottom of the Atlantic, protected or no. It was an excellent movie in regard to the computer imagery, and a marvellous treat for those unfortunates who wallow in disaster for their entertainment. I'm not one of them, and only really watched it out of curiosity after all the hype. I couldn't see what all the fuss was about, and for me even the a pitiful sub-plot couldn't save it. It's not a patch on ""A Night to Remember"" and that was in black and white with no computerised aids. One last comment; I can well understand an upper class girl falling for a working class bit of rough, even in the second decade of the 20th century.

Film-Making on the Grand Scale,JamesHitchcock,29 July 2005,"It was brave of James Cameron to attempt an undertaking on this scale. Making the world's most expensive movie ever is always to tempt fate; the film which had previously held that distinction, the Kevin Costner vanity project ""Waterworld"", had been a disaster in both financial and artistic terms. Even before ""Titanic"" was finished, rumours were circulating that it would be equally disastrous; the critics began preparing their ""sinking ship"" metaphors in anticipation of its failure.In the event, of course, the critics were confounded; the film was a great success, both at the box office and with the Academy, who awarded it eleven Oscars including best picture and best director. It became the most talked-about film of 1997. Eight years on there have been other films on a similar epic scale and some of the excitement it provoked has died away. Nevertheless, even today it stands out as a fine achievement.""Titanic"" combines two quite different genres, the disaster movie and the ""heritage"" costume drama. The late nineties saw a modest revival of the disaster picture, that quintessentially seventies genre, with ""Twister"" in 1996 and ""Dante's Peak"" and ""Volcano"" the following year. Cameron took the basic formula for such films and applied it to a real historical event, making a film on a grand scale with lavish attention to period detail. The real Titanic sinking had a number of features which fitted the genre; it is something of a convention of disaster movies that the disaster should be caused, or at least exacerbated, by the incompetence or complacency of those in authority, an element emphasised here. Bruce Ismay, the Chairman of the White Star Line, proudly proclaims the ship unsinkable, then causes the disaster by urging the captain to steam at top speed through an ice-field. To make matters worse, the company have neglected to provide sufficient lifeboats for all on board.Cameron also imported into the film some of the conventions of ""heritage cinema"". That genre has often been used to examine the British class system, often in films which feature romances between individuals from different social backgrounds, such as Losey's ""The Go-Between"" or Merchant-Ivory productions like ""Howard's End"". Cameron takes the same concept and uses the film to examine the historical roots of the American class system, of which the ship, with its first, second and third class passengers, is a microcosm. Intertwined with the story of the tragedy is the story of the romance between Rose Dewitt Bukater, daughter of an aristocratic Philadelphia family, and Jack Dawson, a struggling artist from a working-class background.The America that we see is not, as is sometimes said, a classless society, nor even one where class is solely determined by wealth. The Dewitt Bukaters, for all their old-money pretensions, are in financial difficulties, and Rose's late father died heavily in debt. Rose's mother Ruth sees that the only way to maintain the family's social status will be if Rose makes a ""good"" marriage to a wealthy man, and a seemingly ideal candidate has presented himself in the shape of Cal Hockley, the son of a nouveau-riche industrialist. Unfortunately, Cal is an arrogant, selfish snob, and Rose cannot bear the thought of marriage to him. She considers suicide by throwing herself off the ship, but is dissuaded from doing so by Jack, and the two fall in love.Some have criticised the film for concentrating on the romance of Jack and Rose, arguing that this focus is somehow demeaning to a real-life tragedy in which over a thousand people died. This is not a criticism with which I would agree. It would clearly have been impossible to tell the personal stories of all those who died; Cameron's aim was to put the disaster into context and heighten its impact by giving us two characters we can care about and to make their story representative of the stories of all those caught up in the drama, thus heightening the film's emotional impact.The film has a number of weaknesses. The liberties taken with historical accuracy, such as the denigration of the character of William Murdoch (who in real life died bravely), can sometimes seem offensive. The opening scenes and closing, which deal with the attempts of a modern salvage team to recover from the wreck a valuable jewel given by Cal to Rose, were possibly unnecessary and certainly overlong, and could easily have been pruned. The acting is not always very good; I was less than impressed by Leonardo Di Caprio as Jack. (In fairness it must be said that he has greatly improved as an actor since 1997, having given a good performance in ""Catch Me If You Can"" and an excellent one in ""The Aviator""). Kate Winslet as Rose was better, although even she fell short of the brilliance she had shown in ""Heavenly Creatures"".The weaknesses are, however, greatly outweighed by the film's strengths. A special mention must go to James Horner's evocative score and Celine Dion's song ""My Heart Will Go On"". There are a number of good performances in minor roles, from Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, shunned as vulgar by her fellow first-class passengers but more good-hearted than any of them, Bernard Hill as Captain Smith, a decent man but without the strength of character to stand up to Ismay's bullying, and Frances Fisher as Ruth, a woman who puts her social status ahead of her daughter's happiness. In the end, however, this is not a film one watches for the acting. I would agree with the reviewer who said that the real star is neither Kate nor Leo but rather the great ship itself, particularly during the spectacular scenes after it hits the iceberg. The success of ""Titanic"" gave Hollywood back the self-confidence to make pictures on a grand scale with daring, energy and imagination, leading to recent epics such as ""Gladiator"" and ""Troy"". 8/10",8/10

In addition, I wouldn't play with it for three hours, or even go back and play with it again four or five times.  ""Titanic"" isn't a ""good"" movie.  As far as the Academy Awards is concerned, I'm sure there are many, many little people who deserved recognition for working hard on this film, and they no doubt received that recognition.  I don't have a problem with that.  As for that arrogant pig of a man, James Cameron, there were at least two other directors far more deserving of an Oscar.  In fact, there were at least two other movies deserving of ""Best Picture.""  Here's a little suggestion for September when ""Titanic"" is released on video : save your money.

Pure popcorn entertainment and an astounding achievement,longcooljolie,12 July 2010,"So far, this is the most heavily user-reviewed movie I have encountered in IMDb. Here is yet another one (sorry)! During the summer of 1997, the studios ran grand coming attractions for ""Titanic,"" which capsulized the entire story and even showed in detail what would happen to Jack and Rose. It was tempting to think ""...why even see the movie? You already know what is going to happen!"" The movie absolutely cleaned up during the holiday season of 1997 and into the first few months of 1998. The theatrical experience of watching it on a big screen with stereo sound was beyond compare (my sister swears that the cinema in Cincinnati where she saw it cranked the air conditioning during the sinking scenes to give viewers an extra dimension to the frigid cold endured by all the passengers).On the surface, the plot lines and basic story seem trite and contrived (poor boy meets rich girl). The fantastic acting by the leads and the direction of the massive cast of extras along with the superhuman attention to detail are what makes Titanic jump from the screen at the viewer.Think about the whole ""king of the world"" sequence with Jack and Fabrizio and the ""flying"" sequence with Jack and Rose. In the hands of a lesser director, both of these would have come across as self-aggrandizing pap, but the way both scenes is shot and Leo DeCaprio/Kate Winslet's uncanny abilities and chemistry sent a shot of ecstasy throughout the whole theater. These scenes, along with several others, works well to capture the fabulous grandeur of the original Titanic.What is most often missed in reviews are the performances of actors in lesser roles, such as Billy Zane's turn as an elegant cad, David Warner's perfect casting as the classy ""thug"" bodyguard, Kathy Bates nailing her gauche, nouveau riche embodiment of the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown (she was a last minute casting), and scores of other astounding recreations from the captain to the top hatted billionaire and his eyes popping out when the water floods the stateroom.According to the trivia page, cinemas wore out their copies and needed replacements. People have probably also worn out their VHS, DVD and blue-ray copies. Nothing will wear out the enduring appeal of this classic as pure, full-on entertainment.",10/10
Smells worse than a baby's poop,lilballa08,15 September 2006,"This by far is one of the most awful movies I've ever seen.

I'm a Leonardo Dicaprio fan, but this movie is a poopy tiny baby diaper.",1/10
The Masterpiece about the two lovers in the sinking ship.,Red_Identity,29 May 2008,"So, I had not seen Tiatnic for like 7 years.I remember the last time I saw it I was about 7 or 8 years old. Since, then, I have not seen it. I remember that at the end, when Jack dies, and Rose is left in the ocean that I cried a lot. A lot of people surely cried. In the last year, I have started to use IMDb, and I see Titanic gets a lot of hate. Well, I decided to see it again to refresh my memory.Let me start off by saying that Titanic gets a lot of hate because of its weak screenplay. Yes, the screenplay is the biggest problem. No, it is not horrible, but there are a lot of cheesy and badly written lines. Some scenes are very unrealistic(like Jack grabbing Rose when she slips in her red dress with only his hand). Also, like when Rose and Jack start to run away from water. Scenes like this make the film look bad, and some lines and dialogue seem unnecessary and poor. BUT let me tell you, that if Titanic wanted to give some emotion to its audience, then in that way, it does not disappoint or fail. The chemistry between Rose and Jack(played beautifully by Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio) is strong. Their love seems real, even though at times it feels too forced, and the way they met is unrealistic. BUT in having a romance story together with a real life tragic, it is done very well. The production design is very well done. The ship and the effects(i am sorry for saying the effects were bad, after seeing it all, they were not), well, they are magnificent. All the stuntmen and the effects done in the actual sinking of the ship is simply amazing. The last hour of the film is so intense, and it looks so realistic, visually, that you can't help but love it for that. Some scenes are so monumental, they are some of the most tragically horrifying scenes in cinema history. The costumes are also well done, for the period of 1912.Another great aspect of the film was the acting. Kate Winslet deserved her Oscar nomination, as did Gloria Stuart. All the actors were on par. The music in the film is simply heartbreaking, The original song by Celine Dion is just WOW. One of the best songs in film history, and its Oscar win is very well deserved. The direction is simply inspiring.Titanic as a whole is satisfying for every film lover. For people who like to be entertained, this is a great film for them, because even though it has some problems, it never fails to entertain, or to emotionally connect with. Yes, this film gets a lot of hate, but the honest truth, is, Titanic is a Masterpiece of its time. i am sure that it will be remembered in 50 years, simple because of how well a film it is. Yes, problems or not, the fictional film about two lovers in a doomed ship just has to be remembered, whether people want it to or not. 10/10",No Rating
You can either love it or hate it,Laitue_Gonflable,7 March 2003,"Titanic, being the most expensive, most publicized, and highest grossing film of all time (at least as of 2003, who knows what the future holds) is one of those films that can either be loved by soft-hearted individuals who love a good story or a well-made piece of cinema, or hated by movie buffs who consider it 'over-rated'. Personally I think it's a little of both.Essentially the real winner of the film is obviously the cinematography and the visual effects; the sinking of the ship is truly a masterpiece of realism and is a shocking perspective on what the sinking of the actual ship might have been like.But aside from the technical side, the film is nothing more than a simple love story, and it is actually quite badly portrayed; the terribly over played comments on class structure and the neverending possibilities of love clash extremely sharply with the very under played relationship between Jack and Rose; there is never a spark between them, and it seems such a short period of time between Jack talking Rose out of killing herself and the two suddenly copulating in the back of somebody else's car in the hold of the ship. It's almost as if James Cameron couldn't decide which elements of the film to over-dwell on and which to just touch upon, because the development of the relationship is one that he could easily have stressed more definitely.The performances as well leave something to be desired. While I have been a long-serving advocate against the talents of Leonardo DiCaprio, this movie is in my opinion, easily his worst. He lacks all the elements that make up a classic film character; charisma, empathy and credibility. As so often ruins a good performance, throughout the entire movie, he is making such an obvious effort to act and it is so apparent visually that the character is lost, and apart from that, it is not a difficult role to play. On the other hand, Kate Winslet is better although not brilliant; she does have charisma and empathy and we can enjoy the character of Rose a lot better. The minor characters are another good element of the film. They don't sparkle but they fill in the story nicely, as minor characters are supposed to do. Jonathan Hyde is excellent as the ship's designer, I felt truly sorry for him when the news is finally broken to him that the Titanic is not, as previously thought, unsinkable.Overall, Titanic is a behemoth of film-making, but that is not quite enough to make it a true classic. It seems too cute, too much like a daytime soap opera to make it a milestone of cinema. Titanic is impressive, nothing more. And while I quite enjoyed watching it, it can never be more than a three star film for me.",No Rating
An absolutely appalling film which is about 2 hours 50 minutes too long.,DW-13,30 August 1999,"I find it difficult to comment on this film because it was so bad.  As far as I can see it has no redeeming features at all.  Titanic is too long, boring and the special effects aren't really very special.There is no attempt to develop the characters and the narrative, far from being a great love story, is just silly.  If the script cost more than ¬£1 it was robbery.I saw this with a friend who commented, as the credits revealed ""Written and Directed by James Cameron"", .. and he should be thoroughly ashamed of himself.This is the sort of film that makes Europeans despise Hollywood. It may have made a lot of money but it was basically worthless.",1/10
How can a movie be so popular with THAT dialogue?,pawn-2,10 March 1999,"I felt this film had some neat effects, but not worth the price of the ticket.  The acting was weak, and the dialogue was horrible. If you haven't seen it yet, you were probably correct to not want to.",1/10
Beautiful film!!!,sofyasand,19 January 2022,"I saw Titanic for the first time at the age of 6, I haven't watched it since, because I cried very much during the viewing and was embarrassed to show it. My parents very often specially took out a VCR and a cassette with this movie and watched, and my mother always cried.Recently, before the release of the film in 3D, I decided to watch it... More than one movie has not affected me like this, I cried both out of pity for the characters and out of happiness that this picture exists.A week later I went to the premiere in 3D... at the end, the audience gave a standing ovation. This picture is beautiful.",9/10
Ignores the fact that women in 1912 - rich and poor - were pretty much property,AlsExGal,12 November 2009,"The special effects are great in this film, and the love story is compelling. Even though there is no uncertainty as to how this movie plays out, it is still quite dramatic and interesting. Plus, you have to marvel at a movie that managed to win the Academy Award for best picture and was also a huge box office hit - a distinction shared with few films over the last twenty years.However, there are a few oversimplifications of the social situation of the passengers in the context of the realities of the early 20th century that bug me every time I watch this movie. First off, there is a heavy handed message of rich = bored and unhappy, poor = genuine and full of life. Given that there was absolutely no social safety net anywhere in the world in 1912, there could be nothing more brutal and grinding than being poor in that era, as if there is any such thing as ""easy poverty"" at any point in history, including today.Second, and somewhat accompanying the first sticking point, is the idea that Rose will somehow be free to be something out of a 1969 Virginia Slim's commercial if only she can lose that rich stiff she is engaged to (Billy Zane's character, Cal) and run off with kindred free-spirit Jack. This illusion not only confronts the fact of grinding poverty in early 20th century America, this flies in the face of entrenched sexism enshrined in the law during that time that wasn't even confronted as a problem until the 1960's. Who, in 1912, is going to let Rose put on a pair of jeans and ride side-saddle on Coney Island? Let her learn to pilot a plane? Allow her to pursue her career goals unless they involve teaching school, nursing, or performing (i.e. doing something that involves serving men)? And even learning those skills cost money she did not have. The fact is at that time a woman in America or anywhere else in the world was considered property. She could either be the property of a rich man (evil Cal) or a poor man. The only main character in this movie that seems to be facing facts is Rose's mother who shows genuine terror at the idea of being poor again - and she SHOULD be afraid, VERY afraid.I once had a 3rd sticking point, but it has been nullified over the last ten years. That sticking point was that Billy Zane's character could feel so superior and entitled given that his wealth and stature were accidents of birth, not the fruits of his own enterprise and imagination. I have since come to realize that some of the smuggest most entitled people on earth are those that were born into their circumstances, so I withdraw that objection.This movie did do a service by dispelling the myth that the slogan on the Titanic was ""women and children first"", when it was, in fact, ""first class women and children first"". In reality, if you were a first-class woman, you had a 97% chance of survival, and just about every first class woman that did die chose to stay behind because she did not want to leave her husband. If you were a female steerage passenger you had about a 45% chance of survival. Worse yet, third class children had a 1 in 3 chance of survival, which was the same rate of survival as the first class men. Not one of either the first or second class children died on the Titanic.Thus, I still enjoy the movie immensely, but I think that the false presentation of early 20th century social reality will always bother me a little every time I watch the film.",7/10
wow!!!,zarkovamilisenta,19 January 2022,"One of my favourite films is Titanic. I'm a great fan of romantic movies and I'm very keen on the history of the tragic Titanic. The movie tells the dramatic story of the Titanic with Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet as the main actors.In the year 1912 a young poor guy, Leonardo, travels by the gorgeous ship Titanic from London to New York with a big dream. On board he meets a fabulous, wealthy girl, Kate Winslet. He fells in love with her as soon as he sees this gorgeous girl. However, after a few days the ship hits an enormous iceberg and the tragedy begins to unfold. The Titanic starts sinking...
The movie is very close to the real tragedy. It shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending. The acting is first-rate. Leonardo Di Caprio's and Kate Winslet's performance is so brilliant that I cried during the whole movie.This movie brings a tear to your eyes. If you want to cry and melt down to a glamorous love story, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie. Titanic is well worth seeing!!!",10/10
what's with all the hype?,monabassil,21 November 2001,"There were three good sides to this film: the beautifully filmed sinking scene, the sets and costumes, and Billy Zane's performance. Add to that the tragic story of the real Titanic, naturally. Besides this, that theme song is irritating, Kate Winslet's performance sucks and her character is simply annoying, and pretty, clean-cut Di Caprio isn't believable as his character, looks wise that is, his performance is not bad. His (double) performance in the Man in the Iron Mask is better, much, much better. All in all, I don't think the movie deserved all that hype, and I definitely wouldn't vote for 'The Titanic' as the best movie of all times. Still, it was a clever idea to use a famous tragedy as an excuse for a lame attempt of a love story!",No Rating
Huge waste of time,putahw-40997,22 October 2020,"Before I saw titanic I heard it was nominated for 10 plus academy awards. Also I heard rave reviews. So I figured it must be a great movie.

Can't deny that most of it really works,Jeremy_Urquhart,28 December 2022,"I guess I got James Cameron fever after watching Avatar 1 and 2 recently. It's been so many years since I saw Titanic, and I remember watching it either on a bus or a plane, which wasn't exactly doing it justice.I don't think this is as good as the Avatar movies. I also prefer the Terminators and Cameron's Alien sequel. But it is better than I remembered. When I was younger, the first half was tedious, and the second half was great. Now, I do appreciate that first half more, but feel like it's about 15-20 minutes too long. All the disaster scenes in the second half still hold up well - there's some corniness and contrivances (the way Rose keeps running into the Titanic's architect starts to get silly), but you do feel the intensity of those moments. It's genuinely distressing in a way that makes me surprised Titanic's one of the most popular movies of all time. I wonder if any of the actual survivors watched this movie, and what they would've thought - some were still alive in 1997.You can criticise some of Cameron's exposition/dialogue as being clunky, and his characters here are very simple. But the characters do still work, and other aspects of the writing are very good- I think the framing device and flashback structure really enhance the core story. Speaking of enhancing the story: James Horner's score is excellent, and does a lot of the emotional heavy-lifting.It's all a technical marvel still, 25 years later, and even if it feels a little overlong, it's still pretty well-paced. Cameron seemed to set out to make a movie that would appeal to everyone, and I guess he succeeded, because Titanic did. The guy knows how to make a successful blockbuster.",8/10
An important story in the history of film,xuefeiding-92364,1 June 2020,"In the background of Titanic shipwreck, the love between rose and Jack is an important stroke in the history of film. The movie not only narrates the love at first sight that spans the gap between the rich and the poor, but also sings an elegy for the touching story that life and death follow at the critical moment. At the same time, in the context of the shipwreck, countless characters on the Titanic face death, some of them are afraid of fear, some of them are calm, and some of them are also amazing.",9/10
An Epic In (Mostly) Every Sense Of The Word,zkonedog,25 February 2017,"For those who were of serious movie-watching age in 1997, ""Titanic"" was more than just a movie...it was a cultural milestone. In an era before the Internet was as omnipresent as it is today, ""Titanic"" still managed to transcend its celluloid and become part of pop culture lore. It easily vaulted to the top of the all-time charts (though has now been passed by ""Avatar"" and ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""). However, along the way ""Titanic"" gained a bit of a reputation as a ""chick flick"", what with ""dreamy Leo"" and the somewhat schmaltzy romance between him and Kate Winslet's character. Fortunately, what I've learned after a recent re-watch of the film is that it still manages to hold up as an epic for all-comers (at least for the most part) despite its branding as sappy.For a basic plot summary, ""Titanic"" tells the story of Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), both passengers on the maiden (and obviously final) voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic. Rose is a member of the ""upper crust"" first class, pledged to be wed to the stodgy, controlling Cal (Billy Zane). Jack is a free-wheeling vagabond who wins his ticket in a poker game just minutes before the ship departs. On the first night of the voyage, Rose has a breakdown and is about to jump from the bow of the ship...until she is stopped by the charming Jack. A Romeo and Juliet-esque romance begins, coming to a head when the great boat strikes an iceberg and beings taking on water.The main reason I can appreciate ""Titanic"" is because I like films that really ""go for it"", so to speak. ""Titanic"" is meant to be an epic, and director/creator James Cameron pulls out all the stops to make that happen. The visually sequences are stunning (the CGI is a bit visible by today's standards, but not terrible), the scope of the project is momentous, and the romance is just as over-the-top to match. Had a lesser film tried to get away with some of the Jack-and- Rose cheesiness pulled here, it would have been a disaster. But for some reason, it just works in ""Titanic"" (again, I think because of the epic nature of the whole project).Cameron also could not have picked a better setting for an epic. We are now over 100 years removed from the fateful sinking, yet it is an event that still carries a high level of fascination...the ""unsinkable ship"" sinks to the bottom of the Atlantic. I think Cameron also makes a great decision to go the high-drama route, as this easily could have been turned into an ultra-realistic pseudo-documentary of the event. I'm sure that (knowing Cameron's style) much research was done to make things as accurate as possible, but the fictional presence of Jack and Rose adds that layer of high drama that turns the whole production into a prestige event.The only reason I can't give ""Titanic"" the full five stars? Well, there's two, actually: First, Cameron really lays the ""class differences"" stuff on thick in the latter stages of the film. It is set up perfectly in the beginning, but as the film drew to a close I wanted to be enthralled by the sinking visuals or swept away in the sheer emotion, not be constantly beaten over the head with the ""first class are conniving snobs while third class are the unsung heroes"" trope. I know from ""Avatar"" that Cameron has little qualms about obviously sticking his own beliefs into films (and doing so quite heavily), so maybe that's just par for the course for his films. Secondly, I honestly believe that better casting could potentially have been done with the Rose character. In no way do I wish to demean the talents of Kate Winslet, as I know she is a wonderful actress in her own right, but I never felt like she was right for this part. She is great as the uptight Rose, but I never really bought into her as the ""moon-eyed lover"" of Jack. It felt odd to me. Luckily, DiCaprio is a joy to behold on screen in the film, so some of the chemistry issues are solved by his sheer enthusiasm.I think that ""Titanic"" is one of those movies that got so big, so fast, that now its reputation proceeds it a bit. I found a similar thing happened to the film ""Dead Poet's Society"". Whereas now standing up on a desk to make a point is ""old hat"", there was a time when it was truly riveting. That same logic must apply to ""Titanic"", too. Whether you are watching it for the first time or re-watching it for the umpteenth time, this is a flick where the slightest bit of cynicism can ruin the entire experience. You have to clear the slate of the mind every single time and enjoy the epic experience for what it is. If you can do that, ""Titanic"" is truly a treasure.",8/10

One of the most beautiful films ever made.,zactac,24 January 2010,"When you first hear about Titanic you immediately think you know whats going to happen (if haven't seen the movie yet you will) you'll think a sinking ship, a quick romance blooms, and a tragic story, well your right. But something about this is different from what you would usually see in a movie with this story.Just about everything in this movie is beautiful including the story, the music, even the tragic ending. When I first heard of Titanic I didn't really care for it at the time. When I was wondering how could this be the first movie to reach a billion dollars and stay the highest grossing movie of all time I decided to watch it and see why other people love it so much. And now I'm one of those people. For those of you that haven't seen Titanic it is a must-see film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet make the perfect on screen couple in Titanic.This is a movie about two different class people that fall in love with each other and they are shunned for it. Rose (Kate Winslet) is a upper class woman being forced to marry a man she doesn't love while Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a poor artist who makes a break getting to go to America again on Titanic. Simple really what happens next he saves her life they fall in love and something tragic happens the end. But how it comes about is really amazing the special effects and the script make such a simple story amazing.This is probably one of the most amazing, beautiful, and purely spectacular films of the 1990's. A must-see for all movie goers.",10/10
All-time Top 10 classic,roystephen-81252,19 February 2016,"Before Titanic, I wasn't really a Cameron-fan. I liked his movies but I never thought of him as a genius (It was only later that I saw his brilliant remake of the French comedy La Totale! ‚Äì True Lies, that is ‚Äì which might have made me appreciate his talents more.) To tell the truth, I wasn't really interested in another adaptation of the tragedy of the Titanic, either. The movie was over-hyped and overpriced, so I thought I'd give it a pass, but I finally gave in to peer pressure. I left the theatre raving about the movie myself.It has remained one of my all-time favourites to this day. Titanic is a true masterpiece that combines a great real-life story with an equally heartbreaking imaginary one and has such visual grandeur and emotional depth that very few movies have managed to bring to the screen. It deserved every single Oscar it was given (save for the score, which is, frankly, a shameless and unimaginative rip-off of Enya's music) and it should have been awarded more. It is a shame that Kate Winslet's, Leonardo DiCaprio's and Gloria Stuart's stunning performances were shunned.It is very sad that since then it has become fashionable to dismiss the movie as a 'corny, boring melodrama', because it is anything but. Titanic is an impeccably written and directed, wonderfully acted and (from a technical point of view) superbly realised, timeless masterpiece. And it has one of the most beautiful lines ever written for the screen. 'A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets'.",10/10
Couldn't be any better than this.....,achraj,14 May 2012,"I saw this movie again and again & noticed more and more dedication and love for this movie..Titanic's central aspect is the love story between Jack and Rose, and the crush it has on Cal. The romantic story isn't original, but this is not a bad thing. Cameron re-invents the story to fit the time period and its characters. Everything fits perfectly, with nothing ever seeming contrived or awkward. Jack's immediate interest in Rose, and Rose likewise, is completely understandable. She is suffering emotionally, and Jack is there to support her. Themes from Romeo and Juliet are included, such as Rose being an upper-classman, and Jack being lower class. But the emotional connection between Rose and Jack is almost palpable, and this fuels the film's first two hours. We watch the trials of Jack and Rose, and as they overcome them, the ship comes closer to destiny. With a ship as large as the Titanic was, it was destined to crash. And of course, the ship isn't stocked with enough lifeboats to accommodate the 2,200 passengers. In the end, over 700 people survive, while the rest drown, freeze, or commit suicide. The resolution of the film, after the ship's gone under, is just as powerful as anything else in the movie. It ends rather surprisingly, with a touching symbolic conclusion. Most films end predictably, or inappropriately, but Titanic ends just on the right note. In fact, the symbolism of the final scene is so perfect, that many people will contemplate over the meaning for months. The film does end rather depressingly, and unexpectedly, but when you think about it, it couldn't have ended any other way. All the questions are answered, and we are left with a weak smile due to the intense situation we were just put through. The Titanic sinking is an emotional roller coaster, with many more realistic deaths than any Independence Day. The death scenes are so realistic, that you find yourself caring for every single passenger. Cameron never compromises the integrity of his film, and the deaths of the passengers is never overemphasized. He doesn't linger on each death, but takes it as it comes to show us the realism without trying to force emotions out of the audience. But emotions do show, and almost anyone will find themselves wiping away a few tears. Hats off for this masterpiece..!",10/10

A Masterpiece from James Cameron,Theflyace,13 February 2014,"Once in every decade since the inception of the motion picture camera, comes a film that seems to transcend criticism and stands the test of time as one of the all time greats. Such is the case with James Cameron's magnum opus, Titanic. This epic recreation of the ocean liner's ill-fated maiden voyage offers everything one can ask for, and more. There is spectacle and dramatic images that sticks with viewers for a very long time.The film begins as a frame story, with a 101 year old survivor, Rose (played by Gloria Stuart), telling a team of treasure hunters and scientists her experience on the Titanic. As a younger woman (now played by Kate Winslet) Rose traveled in first class on the Titanic with her materialistic mother and her haughty fianc√©e Cal (played by Billy Zane) Rose feels completely suffocated by the stiff and mind numbing activities and chatter that comes with being rich, and wants to break out and just do something exciting. Her life changes when she meets third-class artist Jack Dawson (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) As the two talk and hang out more and more, they begin to fall for one another. Of course, her mother and fianc√©e disapprove mainly because he is poor. Everything comes to head when the ship hits an iceberg and begins to sink to her inevitable doom. Some people have made the joke to death that this film is essentially ""Romeo and Juliet on the Titanic."" I see this as only somewhat true, as there are indeed similar elements, but the real story would detract from a by-the-numbers correlation between the stories. Here the love story really works on many levels. Rose and Jack do not fall in love at first sight. When they start talking with one another, they see that they do have much in common. It takes a few days but they decide that they are best for each other and fall completely in love.Cameron has done something very special with all the characters characters in this film. He has always been noted for putting characters and interactions above the story, and so he does here too. Jack, Rose, Cal, Ruth, and Lovejoy are all fictional characters of course, but they all interact very convincingly with the real-life characters. In this way, when the ship sinks, the audience has built up and emotional connection to both fictional and real characters, allowing for more heartbreaking truth when most of the characters die or are in peril when the ship is sinking.The casting of this movie is phenomenal. I have to credit casting director Mali Finn and Cameron for really finding great actors, and some of the best character actors in the business. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet forever made a splash (no pun intended) as two of Hollywood's best leading actors, and have so far proved that they are two of the best.When production began on this film, Cameron knew partial sets and models simply wouldn't do. So he and his crew went out and actually built a huge version of the ship, carpets and all. He is a perfectionist, therefore everything on the ship had to be artistically and physically correct, to lend a greater sense of verisimilitude when the audience viewed it in 1997. It looks simply breathtaking, and we feel like we have been transported to the actual ship itself. As far as we know, Cameron probably knows the Titanic than anyone, so when its shown here in its glory, we believe it. Of course, Titanic is about the sinking of the ""unsinkable"" ship. The final hour of the film is indeed the most gripping, as we see the ship start slipping beneath the waves. Cameron uses his extensive knowledge of special effects to very convincingly present the sinking in all of its gruesome truth. Its very well paced, finely edited, and of course, spectacular. And what makes it even more moving is we have gotten to know the characters and therefore its very heartbreaking when most of them die. The aftermath is of course, very tragic and cruel, because we all know what happened. But when it came on screen, we were still broken by it. When those who couldn't get into the lifeboat drown, we wish in our hearts that they could have. There is more her that will shock viewers, but I wouldn't dream in a million years of revealing the ending of Jack and Rose's story arc.Just as I claimed for Steven Spielberg directing Schindler's List, here, it initially seems like James Cameron is the wrong man for the job at first glance. He is known for action films, no romances or dramas. Yet somehow, this is the greatest film he has ever done. He directs with a keen vision, and is quite unrelenting in getting his vision across, hence why many people despise working with him. But his passion and dedication to the project shines through all the way through its three hour running time. Such dedication won the film multiple Oscars (11 to be precise) Cameron himself took home 4 in one night, cementing his status as one of the most successful filmmakers of our generation.This is one of the best films to grace the cinema. The sheer might and size of the picture doesn't dwarf the actors, who are given the chance to breath and connect us to one of the most infamous tragedies in history. A sharp criticism of man's hubris, and a stirring tribute to those who lost their lives that night. Such is how I can describe Titanic.",10/10
Still a great film!,christophermerritt-36367,6 November 2021,"This film was over hyped in 1997 but it still holds up as a great film. The visual effects still look good today, and the story still pulls on those heart strings. Titanic is great because it has a love story that feels real (even though they only knew each other 2 days) and has great action. Even though iv seen this movie several times it still stresses me out. The supence is real. Other than some dialog everything seems real. Non of the dram seems cheesy. Overall a great film with only a few details i don't love, but with this soundtrack it brings me close to tears.",9/10
a spectacular achievement,Special-K88,26 April 2002,"Big, grand, epic romance is a fictional but vivid and lavish telling of the maiden voyage of the doomed luxury liner. The story spotlights a youthful, star-crossed romance between a blue-collar American wanderer/artist (DiCaprio), and a pampered but open-hearted rich girl (Winslet) yearning to experience life. A long but truly breathtaking retelling of the grandest ship of its time is aided immeasurably by Cameron's stellar direction and marvelous set design, made all the more believable by a superb cast and a finale that's nothing short of remarkable. If you're going to remake history, this is certainly a way to do it. A large-scale epic that actually delivers, one that will be remembered for years to come. ***¬Ω",No Rating

Terrible and too long...,Garys1266,17 May 1999,"I wish someone would tell me what made this such a box office hit with it's rich people bad, poor people good theme.  I would also like to know why it took 3 hours to tell this story, the movie was outrageously slow in most parts.  The acting was also terrible, and there was no visible chemistry that existed between DiCaprio and Winslet.  I have liked DiCaprio in other works i.e. Man in the Iron Mask and I think he has a bright future. The only decent character was Kathy Bates, playing the part of a Nevus Riche socialite.The scenes where they show the boat on the water look very fake.  I would hate to see what Cameron paid to make these scenes.  Also, how did DiCaprio survive for that long in sub-freezing waters?This movie would be great if you were a 13 year old girl who has never had exposure to good film.  On an adult level however I am surprised at the fact that many people liked it because there are many more films out there that are much worthier of praise than this piece of fluff.",4/10
When was the ship going to sink?,sj_bowling,16 January 2007,"This movie is so so overrated. It boggles my mind how this piece of garbage was voted best picture over LA Confidential in 97. The acting in this film is beyond poor, with Billy Zane, yes BILLY ZANE giving the only decent piece of acting in this movie. This movie is comparable to Pearl Harbor, in where we have a historic event get skewed by some sappy, bogus love story about a misunderstood painter. I was surprised and jubilant to find that this movie is out of the top 250 on IMDb as voted by it's users. Thankfully, many other educated users agree with me here.In closing, do not waste your time on this film if you enjoy any realistic movie-making. James Cameron should stick to The Terminator. 2/10",2/10
I feel kind of bad for this movie....,Peaceful224,9 January 2018,"It is true that this movie was over rated when it first came out. It made a billion dollars at the box office and it was on the IMDB top 250 with a rating of 9.6! It was all the rave. But the rating slowly started to sink (no pun intended) and it got low as a 6.9. The movie received extreme backlash. The past few years the rating has been increasing. Titanic has been going through what I like to call ""the rating roller coaster."" It's ratings are constantly changing since everyone has so many different opinions on this movie. I feel kinda bad for it...I understand why so many people don't like this movie. The love story really isn't anything new or different, and the main character Rose can be annoying at times. And of course, like many other people, I am really annoyed about the whole Jack could have survived thing. Like seriously, they both could have fit on the giant floating door! Rose acted like she loved Jack so much, but she barely even tried to get him to fit on the door. All she had to do was move over a little. They wouldn't have even been in the situation if Rose hadn't jumped back on the ship. She should have stayed put in that lifeboat and waited for Jack. He would have had a better chance of surviving, cause then he just has to worry about himself. I feel like their love story may have been a bit exaggerated. I mean, it's good that they wanted to be together forever, but they had only known each other for like four days! Most people don't fall in love that easily or that fast.I have only watched this movie when it comes on TV, and I haven't seen the whole thing because it's SO long. It's like 3 hours. I love the last hour of the movie, which is the boat sinking. I love how it's done and how it's handled. It fills me with suspense every time I watch it. I don't really like anything else about this movie, just the boat sinking. And no, not because people die. It's because it's so suspenseful. I think the way it was handled was really what it was like in 1912.",5/10
Big and dumb (spoilers),Ricky_Roma__,11 August 2007,"The Abyss should have served as an ominous warning. As enjoyable as that film is, when it came to the relationship between Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio it contained some of the most risible dialogue committed to film. Thankfully, though, it was only a small part of the story. However, with Titanic, the romance is front and centre. It's what everything hangs upon.Anyone familiar with James Cameron should know that he's terrible at writing anything that can be vaguely construed as romantic. As well as The Abyss, you have Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese's courtship in The Terminator. Full of hackneyed dialogue, puppy dog looks and embarrassing sex, it's the only weak link in an otherwise excellent film. But with Titanic you have to swallow scene after scene of it, until you end up puking all over yourself like a tramp on a park bench.One of the most laughable scenes is when Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) shows Rose (Kate Winslet) his artwork. His portfolio is full of nudie drawings. And there's one girl that he seems particularly fond of. But when Rose suggests that maybe he and this woman had a thing going on, he laughs it off, saying that she was a one-legged prostitute. Why should this stop him? It didn't stop Paul McCartney.But earlier in the scene Jack says that this woman had beautiful hands. He's about as convincing as an artist as Denise Richards is as nuclear physicist. And later on, when he draws Rose in the buff, he's supposedly so professional that he doesn't try anything on ¬ñ there are no sleazy attempts to give her one. What kind of artist is he? But you can hardly blame Jack. He looks about twelve ¬ñ he's probably terrified that Rose is going to crush him to death with her bountiful bosom. Indeed, when he draws her, he seems to be doing his best to ignore her womanly curves ¬ñ all the hair flicking and concentrated glances are a blatant attempt to either ignore the rod that is pitched in his trousers or to keep him from crying in fear.However, as hard as Jack tries to avoid sleeping with Rose, she eventually traps him in some ye olde car. She even asks him to take her to the stars (quality dialogue, Jim!). And there she has her wicked way with the timorous youth. Poor guy. He even looks close to tears as he lies trembling on top of her. I don't know why he reacts in such a way. If he's a virgin, as his actions and general attitude suggest, he should be doing penile handstands for scoring such a fine piece of ass.But as risible as the romance is, the thing that irritated me the most was one of Jack's friends ¬ñ some Irish guy called Tommy who he meets on the ship. He's meant to be a lovable, salt of the earth type guy, but I just wanted him dead. Indeed, the bit where he gets shot by one of the White Star Line officers genuinely had me cheering. And he gets shot after calling the White Star Line guy a ""Limey bastard"". England 1 Ireland 0. But this Tommy character is meant to be someone we can root for. But instead he's a selfish, mealy-mouthed, drunken idiot. To hell with him.And the whole idealising of the Irish is a major problem I have with the film. They're all wonderful people. The English, though, by and large, are scum. They're either cowardly, psychotic or brandy drinking fools. The only Englishman who comes out half okay is the Captain, and even he crashes into an iceberg and carks it in the end.But back to the idealising of the Irish ¬ñ the music is insufferable. It's that whole Enya-style pseudo-Gaelic crap. I wanted to stab myself in the ears with a pencil. And then, of course, there's Celine Dion. What a rancid song that is at the end. It's like being sodomised by a rhino.The only character I sort of half-liked was Billy Zane's lackey. But that's because he's a total bastard. He falsely plants evidence on Jack, punches him in the gut and acts like a jerk at every opportunity. What a guy. And I guess Billy Zane (a.k.a. Kelly Brook's penis) is okay as well. Although I do have to say that his face freaks me out somewhat. It's got a plasticy, Michael Jackson-style look about it. Plus he seems to be wearing lots of eye-liner. But I do enjoy his general wretchedness, especially the way he survives the sinking. He kidnaps a child and hops onto a lifeboat, declaring that he's all the kid has in the world. To hell with your self-righteous Irishmen and fop-haired artists, this is what we need ¬ñ hammy, rubber-faced industrialists who are only interested in saving their own skins.But unfortunately Kelly Brook's penis can't save the film. It's a tedious, terribly written mess that has one of the most risible wraparound stories seen in cinema. I really have no idea how that old lady got an Oscar nomination. I think the Academy were just impressed that she hadn't snuffed it yet. But at least the very end gives us hope that the Rose character dies. She lies there on her bed surrounded by her pictures and then returns to the Titanic and all the people who died that night. Is she now stuck on that ship, locked in sweaty, teary union with her wretched boy-toy for the rest of eternity? One can only hope.",No Rating
I'm not really a religious man,Flatline005,21 March 2002,"Generally I'm very much agnostic when it comes to heaven and hell, the afterlife, what you do in this lifetime decides what your afterlife will be like. This film just about changed my mind.You see.... what scares me is that IF there is indeed a heaven and hell then at this time in my life I'm not quite sure which one I'll be going to....That doesn't sound so scary you say. Let me elaborate..I believe that if there is indeed a hell, then for me it would consist of watching an endless loop of a grown woman standing on the bow of a ship proclaiming ""I can fly!"" and a big thank you from myself goes out to the makers of this film for providing just the source of that punishment for me when I do eventually end up in the afterlife.Ahhh thats off my chest now. So what can I say about Titanic?James Cameron. I am actually  what you'd call a fan of his work. Terminator, Aliens, Strange Days, The Abyss. Much of the work he has had a hand in I rate as some of my favourite movies ever. So what possessed him to do this?????Kate Winslet and Billy Zane. These are two of my favoured actors..What possessed them to do this??? If you want to see Kate Winslet in a GOOD film try to find ""Heavenly Creatures"" which is indeed an excellent film. Likewise for Billy Zane get a hold of ""Dead Calm"".In essence this film is 2 + hours of cliched, Low IQ, utterly awful, Mills & Boon romance that is so sugarcoated it's likely to send any diabetic person watching it into a fit. The ONLY saving grace of this film is the final hour after the Titanic has struck the iceberg and then proceeds to sink which is when we are treated to the James Cameron we know and love. It's just a damn shame that to get to this part I had to sit through 2 hours+ of a film that made my eyes bleed.The sheer amount of money this film has made at the box office as well as the quite high rating it receives here on IMDB is truly a testament to the old adage that there's no accounting for (bad) taste.OverallThe prospect of hammering rusty nails through my manhood is infinitely more appealing than that of watching the first 2 hours of this film ever again.3 stars out of 10 (solely for the last hour but having to sit through the first 2 hours of this atrocity to get to this stage is simply unforgiveable).",1/10
"Even though the ship sank, it's still a very good movie",PWNYCNY,31 July 2005,"Titanic is Hollywood's biggest moneymaker in history and for good reason - it is a great movie. This movie is about sacrifice, selflessness, love, devotion, joy, passion, all occurring on a doomed ocean liner that suddenly and without warning sinks, resulting in one of the worst maritime catastrophes in history. Kate Winslett is magnificent as the young girl, Rose, barely a teenager, who is being pressured by her overbearing mother to marry Cal, a nasty, brutal man who has only contempt for his unwilling fianc√©. That Cal is rich just makes his behavior worse. Rose, by nature a gentle spirit, is angry and desperate to escape, so much so that she is about to commit suicide when she is saved by a young man, Jack, who, despite his shabby appearance, is a well-traveled, sensitive and upbeat artist who treats the troubled young lady with gentleness and respect and she responds. Their love for each other is instantaneous and unconditional and they are willing to die for each other. This is not such an implausible scenario and there is absolutely nothing immoral about their behavior. Rose willingly gives herself to Jack out of love for him, and even decades later still thinks of him as her one and only true love, the man who died for her so she could live. That is love. That is sacrifice. That is life. That is Christian. That they were not formally married is a mere technicality. Given the circumstances of their meeting. a loving and understanding G-d will forgive them. Now regarding the diamond that was given to Rose, instead of cashing it in like she could have, she kept it as a memento to her one true love. That is called character. Nothing unchristian about that. Indeed, the movie is actually about how Rose undergoes a complete transformation from a passive, unhappy, moody adolescent into a composed, mature, independent and beautiful woman, even changing her name, now prepared to go on to live a long and active life. That is, she experiences an epiphany. That is called personal growth which is quite Christian and most exemplary. As for Jack, he is with Rose in spirit and she lives her life accordingly, knowing that if it were not for him she would not have survived. Jack gave his life for Rose so she could live. That is powerfully compelling and completely consistent with Christian teachings.Maybe I shouldn't say this, but I will: I was waiting for the ship to sink because I was hoping that when the ship sank the movie would end ... but it didn't, and for that I was disappointed. To me, the story of the the Titanic is what happened to the ship, not some contrived, fictional, and highly improbable love story between a Little Miss Rich Girl and a Mr. Nice Guy Ne'er Do Well. The movie is weak for two reasons: First, the movie is asking me to believe that a young lady would dump her handsome, powerful, influential and above-all wealthy fianc√© who has her mother's approval in favor of a no-account nobody who didn't even belong on the ship. Second, since we already know what's going to happen to the ship, much of the excitement is lost. Nevertheless, the portrayal of how the ship actually sank, and the resulting pandemonium, was effectively done. So if the movie had gotten rid of the love story and concentrated instead on how the passengers and crew coped with the impending sinking of the ship, that could have been the basis for an exceedingly dramatic story. But Hollywood being Hollywood, if the story doesn't include at least a smidgen of sex and a big dose of sentimentality, no matter how contrived, then that story won't be the one that makes it onto the screen, and this movie is proof of that statement. As further proof of that statement consider the final scene in which Little Miss Rich Girl, who's now something like 100 years old and a great-grandmother, tosses a multimillion-dollar diamond overboard in the name of love. Even for a movie that's unbelievable. It would have been better if she had used the diamond to pay for a salvaging operation to recover the divan on which she had posed nude for her boyfriend, Mr. Nobody, who, by sheer coincidence, also happened to be an accomplished artist. (Duh!) Now THAT would have made for a good story. The movie could have been entitled: ""The Titanic - The Story of a Woman and the Divan that Made Her Famous."" Now if somebody out there would like to advance me 50 or 100 million dollars to make this movie, then we'll be in business.",8/10

Complete Waste of Budget,Leviat,13 August 1998,"Let me Start by saying I really, truly, and without a doubt mean every word I am going to say here:What is so special about this movie?!@#  This has got to be the longest, most pathetic, boring excuse for Oscar Bait I have ever seen, and that's even comparing it to some of the other doozies that Hollywood has honored in the past.  First of all, Leonardo Can't act to save his life.  What was the official word at the casting call?  ""Must be able to stand in front of the camera and bring in teenage women""?  And Kate Winslet, who I have respected in the past, completely lost her abilities as well.  You wait two hours for anything to happen, and when it does, it happens so slowly that I hardly even noticed.  As for the special Effects, I've seen better Special Effects in movies with MUCH smaller budgets.  Want to know what the best part of the movie was?  When I went to go see it, right before the end credits, the film melted and the projector caught on fire.  I was quite happy to realise that a copy had been partially destroyed.  This is a terrible excuse for a film.  How can you not agree when the machinery showing it commits suicide??",1/10
Epic Love Story 'Titanic' Now on DVD and Blu-ray,rannynm,29 October 2012,"Titanic, newly released from Paramount Pictures on Blu-ray3D and digital, didn't completely sweep the Academy Awards in 1998 ‚Äì it only took 11 of the Oscar statuettes!

Seasoned KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Raven Devanney, age 15, calls Titanic a ""romantic masterpiece."" The film evokes strong emotion partly because of the real-life tragedy it recreates but also thanks to the intimate love story Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet bring to life.

TitanicReviewed by Raven Devanney See her full review on video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huGlaj1F_d0 Titanic is my favorite movie by far. This romantic masterpiece starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet tells a tale of love, loss and tragedy. I remember the first time I watched Titanic. I was 7 years old, and I've been hooked ever since. This was the first film that really made me cry, and even though I've seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up. This movie is beautifully done. I love that the cinematography is so grand and breathtaking even though the film came out in 1997. I especially love the way they capture the Titanic in all its glory. I'm a total history geek when it comes to the Titanic. I've seen every documentary and read every book there is to read about the Titanic, so the fact that they used actual footage of the wreckage of Titanic was really cool. My favorite characters are Rose and Jack, of course! They defy the rules of their different social statuses and are in true love. Not only are those characters great, but Kate and Leonardo do a masterful job in these roles. I love the whole movie, but my favorite scene would have to be when Rose and Jack are running through the ship away from the butler after the drawing scene. It lightens the mood of the film before the sinking and is quite funny. Plus, you almost get a mini tour of the ship. I also admire the final few scenes in which the ship is sinking. The way it is captured is amazing. It's the perfect mix of chaos and emotion, which really conveys the tragedy in a brilliant way. Like I said, this film is very tragic, and that fact that it was an actual event makes it even more sad. I would recommend this film for all ages, even though it is sad and slightly inappropriate. I watched it when I was 7 and nothing bothered me. This is a must-see movie, and I give it five out of five stars. I'd give it more if I could! Titanic is in stores now on DVD and Blu-ray, so be sure to add it to your home movie collection today!",10/10
Fall of the Titans,jonathanruano,12 October 2009,"Just as the ship that couldn't be sunk sank in 1910, the movie ""Titanic"" which should not have failed went belly up and fell to the bottom of the sea. I seem to be going against the grain here and maybe I was the only one seeing this movie who didn't get it. I readily that there are great moments in this movie. The dramatic sequence where the Titantic ship becomes flooded with water and eventually sinks to the bottom is brilliant. What director James Cameron also does very well in exposing the sheer unfairness that some were allowed on the life boats, while others were not. In that connection, there was a emotive scene with a navy officer who, often against his own will, enforced this unfair system to the letter, not because it was the right thing to do, but because there were only so many life boats to go around and the prevailing view was that the few life boats available should go to the rich -- with the result that the rest were, in effect, left to die. What is also very good is that scene where some of the passengers are floating in the ice cold water, clinging on to whatever they could get their hands on, and quickly freezing to death.Yet, the film still does not quite work because of what preceded this sad, dramatic tragedy that was the sinking of the titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack and Kate Winslet's Rose were plausible characters, but they were very annoying to watch. Some of their lines were so out of place and absurd that I felt deeply embarrassed watching these people. The love story seemed rather contrived and unbelievable. Finally, James Horner's music in the background just made the whole thing worse. In short, I did not feel anything for these characters or identify with their love story; and that, more than anything else, was what dragged this movie down.",5/10
Titanic,jboothmillard,13 June 2005,"This is one of the greatest romance drama and disaster movies ever made, and also the most expensive movies (costing around $200m) from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director James Cameron (Terminators 1 + 2, Aliens). This is the nearly completely accurate depiction of the 1912 disaster of the ""unsinkable"" Southampton launched cruise liner Titanic. One of the biggest ships ever made Titanic is heading to New York. Jack Dawson (Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio) is the lucky tramp who won tickets with his friend to go onto Titanic. While touring the boat and meeting new friends he sees engaged Rose Dewitt Bukater (the gorgeous Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Kate Winslet). Jack and Rose form a very close friendship, which obviously becomes more. Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) is the nasty guy who is wanting to marry Rose. Unfortunately, Jack and Rose are soon threatened along with 2,200 people from the iceberg causing the sinking of the ship, what steals the show. Very teary towards the end and a beautiful story of courage and passion.

Quite Simply the best movie of all time,Listen_to_the_Law,2 July 2007,"Titanic, the highest grossing movie of all time, is also quite possibly the greatest movie of all time. The story of the fatal April 1912 voyage of the quote-unquote ""unsinkable"" Titanic is told here with mastery and real present time footage. The beginning of the film is narrated by Gloria Stuart (playing the part of old Rose with superb detail and presence). She tells a Titanic recovery team about her experience on the ship on that night. After that is when the movie officially begins.Titanic helped launch the career's of its two main stars: Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) is a poor English boy traveling across to the United States, mostly for the thrill of the ship, but also to be able to earn some money. Rose Bukater (Winslet) is a rich English girl who is only on the Titanic because her mother and father are traveling to America. Dawson and Bukater meet on the bow of the ship and are together throughout the film until the very end.It's hard to write a review for a movie that simply can not be described in words. The movie may just seem like a typical love story with a major trap, but it is so much more. James Cameron is truly the best director around. To be able to tell a simple story with such a masterful presence like this is remarkable. The movie will get you emotionally involved (at least it did for me).

Fabulous movie,GreyJug,23 July 2020,"This is a very good film, and the special effects in this film are done well. This film focuses on the tragedy of the sinking of the titanic but it still shows a lot of happiness like times when Jack and Rose spend time together before the titanic sinks so this film doesn't entirely give a sad feeling. Rose is pretty in this film and her romance with Jack is very nice in this film. I think that it is the right decision that Jack dies at the end of this film because it helps to show just how tragic the sinking of the titanic was. There has been good choices of music picked to be played in this film and the acting in this movie is good. Also Rose looks, talks and behaves in a way when she is 101 years old which is similar enough to when she is 17 years old for it to be believable that she is indeed the same person and this is an interesting idea. The tension as the titanic sinks is shown well in this film and it feels like the time it takes for the titanic to sink lasts longer than it does, which is a good idea because it makes it even more dramatic that way and when terrible things happen they often feel like they last for longer than they actually do.This film makes it clear just how awful the sinking of the titanic was, and shows it in a lot of detail. In the part of this film where Jack is chained to a room, the fear that he will drown is very evident and the build up of how the sinking of the titanic keeps getting worse is a good idea for this film; at first the titanic is not filled with much water but this keeps getting worse though. I like how as this ship sinks, people other than Jack and Rose are shown. There is a lot of detail in this film which all looks very real and the titanic in this film looks very big. Occasionally Kate Winslet's acting and Billy Zane's acting in this film could be better than it is and I don't think that Kate Winslet's American accent sounds very convincing. Also I think that what this film shows of what happens on the titanic before it sinks should show a bit more than it does of people other than Jack, Rose, Ruth and Cal because in real life there were a lot of passengers on the titanic so I think that this film should focus on more characters than it does at this point. Also I think that the part of this film where Cal tries to show people while on a sinking ship is not realistic enough. But I have much more good than bad to say about this movie which is why I have given it 9 out of 10.",9/10
The Closest Modern Cinema Ever Came to the Ham and Cheese Epics of the '50s,sailor-mac-43282,7 January 2022,"Back in the '50s, Hollywood was terrified of losing its audience to television - so they made their movies big, bigger, biggest. Epic length, epic effects, epic costumes, epic hairstyles. Sure, the scripts had more cheese than a quesadilla, but who cared? Look at that massive crowd of extras! Look at all those horses! Look at all those extras RIDING horses!Fast-forward to the late '90s, where James Cameron brought back the big, bigger, biggest epic in the form of this movie. HUGE ship! HUGE disaster! HUGE cast of extras! HUGELY corny romantic plot! And did we eat this all up? Oh, HELLZ, yeah. Rather than warmed-over leftovers, Cameron made the over-the-top epic feel like a fresh dish.One big difference between this film and old-school epics: the quality of the acting. Rather than fill it with scenery-chewers, Cameron built his film around a pair of genuinely talented and appealing performers, Kate Winslet and Leonardo diCaprio. They managed to sell the creaky Romeo-and-Juliet-at-sea premise with genuine warmth and sincerity, and you found yourself rooting for them even as they were spouting dialogue that sounded like bumper stickers.The visuals are, of course, an absolute feast - we revel in the glory of the ship in the first two-thirds and in its destruction at the end. There's lush shots of luxurious dining halls and boisterous dancing peasants, of dolphins poking up through the water and vistas of Edwardian outfits at a church service - giving way to floods, destruction and terror. It's A LOT, and you gladly drink in it all.We hadn't seen an epic like this in years, and given the move toward streaming, we may never see one like it again.

"The sheer spectacle makes it good, but flawed entertainment",ametaphysicalshark,14 June 2009,"It's not too hard to figure out what kept audiences flocking to ""Titanic"" when it came out. The sheer spectacle of it as well as the sweeping sense of romance which Cameron succeeds in evoking made this a 'must-see' theatrical experience. At the time and even for a while after, ""Titanic"" seemed like it would go down as an epic for the ages, a masterpiece with the overwhelming reputation of classic epics like ""Gone With the Wind"". The Oscar wins seemed to cement that.Then came the backlash, which was inevitable for any film with this sort of popularity. The thing is, ""Titanic"", to some extent, deserved its backlash. It is obviously nowhere near as bad as some say, but viewed today, 12 years later, in a home setting away from the 'theatrical experience' many enjoyed back then, the movie's flaws are easily exposed. The screenplay is really not strong at all, the characters are more like caricatures, and the romance not particularly convincing. At most, during the excruciatingly long hour and some spent on set-up, this romance which Cameron seems to think is the epitome of romantic cinema, a love affair to match the scope of the film, seems like a cute fling. Jim Cameron's knack for writing some truly execrable dialogue is not gone just yet, and while I can knock back a beer or two (or seven) and watch Ripley lay waste to xenomorph after xenomorph in ""Aliens"" while cracking one-liners, it's a little hard to take in this setting. Still, most of the dialogue is solid or average, and there are some good lines. The narrative structure and momentum is nothing special at all- poor dude meets rich girl, they 'fall in love', Titanic hits the iceberg and then there's an hour of running here and there and special effects. So the film was over-hyped, yes. Jim Cameron's previous films were all better, bar ""True Lies"" and his cheap debut feature ""Piranha 2"", but that doesn't mean ""Titanic"" doesn't have its positive points. It is obviously a wonderful technical achievement that still stands tall, is very nicely-shot, and there are a number of excellent scenes. Indeed, the sheer spectacle of the final hour and some, from the moment the ship hits that iceberg, is still easy to get carried away by, and Cameron proves that he is more than capable as a popcorn entertainer. DiCaprio is very charming and proves himself as a dramatic actor in the latter stages while Winslet does her typically annoying nonsense, but on the negative side Horner's score is pretty mediocre. It's a good enough film, over-hyped yes but that is the fault of the public, not the film, which remains flawed but ultimately fairly enjoyable, on par or better than most big budget flicks and disaster movies, but it's no masterpiece, and now excuse me, I'm going to watch ""Aliens"" again.",No Rating

"Bad, bad, bad... (did I tell you it's bad?)",zio ugo,20 January 1999,"Although it is easy to see how this brainless saga could appeal to an equally brainless segment of the public, it is much harder to understand the honors that have been bestowed on this mediocre (albeit expensive) production. The special effects were pretty good, and the details of reconstruction of some of the inanimate objects was remarkable. The problem was in the animate entities.The main characters are anachronistic: essentially 90's teenagers dressed in funny turn-of-the-century clothes. If you are thrilled by the fact that Rose decided to follow her heart instead of the social conventions of the time, you should consider having your fiancee/wife/daughter run away with a gang member she only met two days ago. It is easy to laugh at the social conventions of 90 years ago. A film aiming at a meaningful social discourse should make us look critically at contemporary mores. It is easy to laugh at the Victorian sexual code. Let us laugh at monogamy if we have the courage!I expect a historic film to help me understand the age it refers to, and to help me relate it to my age. Placing to MTV teenagers in a 1912 as real as Conan the Barbarian's middle ages doesn't help me do either.Some of the scenes are artificially emotionally charged (e.g. the two lovers looking from the bow of the ship to the horizon) but one cannot escape the impression that the number, intensity, and sequencing of these scenes come from some ""How to make a movie"" manual that you can probably buy for $10.95 at the nearest Barnes and Noble. All in all, I would say that the film reveals a decent craftsmanship, but not a single shred of art (a situation not uncommon in Hollywood).I saw this film in a theatre, and I don't feel any need to see it again at home. I have better things to do with my time. But if all you like in a film is to go see some special effects, and saying ""ooooo..."" when the ship sink, and ""aaaaah...."" when the main characters kiss, then this is the film for you.",1/10
A true cinematic epic.,Hojangs,13 September 2012,"A film of such incredible proportions is a rarity in cinema. 'Titanic,' was recently re-released on Blu-Ray, and I took the opportunity to watch the film for the first time in over a decade. I was 8 years old when I last saw this film, something which probably contributed to my opinion that the film was over-long, soppy and incredibly dull. How wrong I was.'Titanic,' is epic cinema at its finest. So many aspects of the film are truly wonderful, the scale, the performances and the design to name a few. James Cameron has repeatedly cemented himself as one of the most talented directors in Hollywood, managing to craft gargantuan products with colossal budgets and still maintain a wonderful human emotion to his works. Though the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 serves as the basis for this film, the true meat of it is a love story between two young people from polar opposite ends of society; Jack Dawson, played by a boyish Leonardo DiCaprio, a lower class drifter with a gift for art, and Rose, a higher class young woman trapped in the confines of a loveless engagement, portrayed by a fresh-faced Kate Winslet. Over the course of 3 hours and 14 minutes their love story plays out among the hundreds of stories of that fateful voyage that tragically killed so many.The true wonder of 'Titanic,' is its sheer scale. The film was originally released in 1997, yet the production dwarfs that of most large scale films of today's Hollywood. The costume design and set production is absolutely staggering, truly worthy of the Oscars the design and production won. The special effects are also worth praising, especially considering that the film is now 15 years old. However, with the transition to Blu-Ray, and the clarity that the image receives because of the transfer, some of the effects are unfortunately rather obvious, though this does nothing to detract from the overall experience. The sound design is also excellent, particular praise reserved for the score. There is an almost Enya-like quality to the score, gentle and mellow yet rousing in all the correct places.The performances are all excellent. DiCaprio and Winslet both carry the production on their young shoulders, and do so with aplomb. Their chemistry is impressive, and both actors are pleasant and likable. Billy Zane, as Rose's arrogant fianc√©, is suitably horrid and despicable, and Zane gives probably the best performance of his career. All roles are performed well, including Kathy Bates as a 'new-money,' socialite and Bernard Hill as the captain of the doomed voyage. There are so many moments from this film that are frequently quoted and fondly remembered, and there's a reason. 'Titanic,' is an incredible experience, and well worth picking up on Blu-Ray. I'm certainly glad I did.",9/10
A movie that opens your heart.,nanancay,9 August 2018,"The only romance movie that doesn't feel contrived, it brings you back to a time where you could love with careless abandon. The freeing nature of the two characters and breaking from their social classes to be together is very Romeo and Juliet, but the intense romance between them is something to be seen. That love alongside the unusual combination of a disaster paints a strangely beautiful picture of love.",9/10
A Truly Epic Film!!!,Pumpkin_Man,10 July 2011,"It's been a long time since I've watched this movie from beginning to end, so I decided to refresh my memory. I forgot how great and sad this film is. It has great characters that we come to love, and a powerful forbidden love storyline. In 1996, Brock Lovett and his team explore the Titanic wreckage in search for a necklace called the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they find a nude drawing of a woman named Rose, who was wearing the necklace the night Titanic sank. Rose is now an elderly lady, and tells Brock and his team her story aboard the Titanic.In 1912, teen-aged Rose is a first-class passenger, and going to England with her fianc√© Cal. Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson wins a ticket aboard the Titanic. When Rose wants to commit suicide, Jack talks her out of it, and they soon start a relationship, defying Cal and her mom. Soon, Titanic hits the iceberg and slowly begins to sink. Every passing minute, Jack and Rose try to find a way off the doomed ship together or not at all. If you're a history buff and want a smart love story, you'll love TITANIC!!!",10/10
A great adventure film that will make you obsessed with the Titanic.,albertsmith-32785,1 August 2018,"Titanic was a massive success upon release and still continues to be immensely popular. It is easy to see why: Jim Cameron is a master filmmaker and the set for the film- the ship itself is so awe inspiring you'd be fooled into thinking this was the real ship. The film is incredibly well paced- despite being quite long and the casting is top notch. Titanic made stars out of Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio and they are quite good here. One can see why Leo became a heartthrob after this film came out- he is very good. Jim Cameron has a passion for the Ocean and he seems right at home directing Titanic. Its funny to think that Titanic's box office record was eventually broken by his own Avatar, which is a testament to his talent as a storyteller and filmmaker.",9/10
Icebergs aren't the only disaster in this Blockbuster piece of Cinematic Crap,ben-152,19 August 2006,"When I was around 5, Titanic came out and my parents had seen it in theaters and hated it. I, however found a big love for the movie, my friends played Titanic on the playground, my friend owned the video and I eventually saw it, well half of it since I wasn't ready for the distress and peril. As I grew, I learned how cheesy, formulaic and just plain god awful this movie was.To start off, I think that the scenery, costumes and sets are magnificent, and some of the characters give life in their roles (The man who played the Captain, Victor Garber and Kathy Bates) the rest, however are just irritating and trying too hard to make their performance stand out. And they do, just not in a good way. Kate Winslet is just a snobby girl who obviously is misunderstood and wishes her mother would listen to her, Leonardo Dicaprio is just a vile, poor boy who seems an awful lot like a rude and bratty version of Tramp(Who is from a rich girl meets poor boy story that works, ""Lady and the Tramp."") Billy Zane plays Rose's Fianc√©, Cal and uses an accent that mocks the British as do most of the other supporting actors. Plus, Cal is convinced that the ship is unsinkable, as is everyone, except Rose who is ""educated"" (apparently knowing who Freud is makes her a smart scholar.) But she's a girl! Why listen to her?! This Ship is Unsinakble! It is she who notices that they're aren't enough lifeboats, but is reassured once again by another man that the ship can't and won't sink. Enoguh on that, let us talk about the main plot.Titanic was a ship that was to sail from Ireland to New York, we all know that. But, it seems that the Director, James Cameron (Who is usually a good director and who redeemed himself with Ghosts of the Abyss.) does not know anything but that small fact, and that many Irish people were in third class. The many wonderful stories about the ship, not that the death of many people is a good thing, but that the tales survivors have passed down about their voyage on the Titanic. If James contacted the few still alive or read a book, he would maybe make this film get two stars for researching the stories of the ships passengers. Anyway, Rose is on the ship with her mother and fianc√©, but she is not happy. Jack is a poor boy who wins tickets to the Titanic in a game of poker and lives his life to its fullest. They meat while suicidal Rose is about to jump and Jack won't let her. If this were the real world, any chance that these two would meet, or that she would even come near the third class deck would be very slim. So long story short, he saves her from falling. While doing so, the police hear screams coming from her and when they arrive, it appears that he is raping her. They arrest Jack, but Rose says that he saved her and he goes scotch free. Then, their bond begins.Already, within the first forty five minutes am I bored, waiting for the ship to sink and not center around these two bratty kids who never even existed, but the story makes them as big as the ship itself. So these two become friends and Jack teaches Rose how to live a little, which means he gets her to hock spit and dance at a drunken third class party and escape the upper prestigious class. Soon Rose begins to realize, Do I even love Cal? Is Jack the one for me? He understands her and she understands him, unfortunately her mother disapproves of their romance because he's poor and she's engaged. Rose then tries to end her romance with Jack, but like every other romance movie she goes with the man she just met and apparently the choice was right. They stand on the edge of the ship and ""fly,"" he draws her nude only wearing her necklace Cal gave to her as an engagement present. If you have been living in a cave or hopefully haven't heard of Titanic, these scenes are none as its most memorable, as is their sex scene in the back of a car. Luckily, the iceberg hits and all hell breaks loose. After Cal insisting it won't sink it does! And nobody listen to Rose! Cal wants her, but she says, ""I'd rather be a whore then your wife."" Soon enough, Jack and Rose are together in the water all cold and near death, but they can still churn out cinematic waste. While watching it, I found their love being broken not as important as the many people dying right next to them. And before you know it, Jack dies. It would be pretty obvious because when a disaster occurs, one of the lovers is bound to die. Eventually, selfish Rose is rescued and calls herself Rose Dawson, which makes me laugh. She knows him for two days and then considers their little unimportant romance like marriage, Please. The end is when the diamond the explorers are searching for isn't found, Rose has it, she dumps it over the edge and then meets Jack in heaven. There, I saved you three hours of your life.Adding on to the boring love story, the music sounds like Enya half the time and the rest like music you hear in a Nordstrom's store at the mall(the theme is sung by sea wench Celene Dion another disaster for the film). The script sounds like a dreary English paper using vocabulary words I learned in seventh grade. At least it is when the two lovebirds aren't screaming ""Jack! Jack!"" or ""Rose!!"" The star goes to scenery, and it stays that way.",1/10
I like love stories on boats,xan-the-crawford-fan,3 August 2021,"The love stories that take place on cruise ships/ocean liners are things like Letty Lynton (1932), Love Affair (1939 one) and Now, Voyager (1942). All three of those are fairly melodramatic, have a touch of tragedy, but they all end up well in the end. And they're well done- good cinematography, good acting, the leads have chemistry, and I want Joan Crawford's Letty Lynton dress in my wardrobe. What does this film have to offer?A cure for insomnia and major disappointment. Not that I was expecting anything going in.I think I set a record for complaining- I moaned all the way through this film when my mother forced me to watch it. She loves it, but I think she just loves it because of the sheep mentality that newer films force on us. This film (if one can call it a film) has a twenty minute plot padded out into three hours and fourteen minutes. Neither Winslet nor DiCaprio can act to save their lives, they don't have any chemistry...and...guess what...Kate Winslet bares her breasts again! Did she ever do anything else? These people are Oscar-winning actors? Don't make me laugh. The rest of the supporting cast may as well be made of cardboard. Kathy Bates was just annoying. All the characters were clich√©s to begin with, not even actors that could act could have pulled this film off.The director is not a good director. He uses generic, already used shots from other films. Kate Winslet's ""contemplating suicide"" scene is borrowed from Mildred Pierce (which, funnily, Kate would go on to star in a craptastic remake of.) I was actually cheering when the boat started sinking.But then it got boring, because that five minute plot device was the second half of the film.I also cheered when Leonardo DiCaprio died, because I don't like him, he's not attractive (he doesn't even have charisma) and he's got a stupid haircut that no-one had in 1912, or even 1952. Another cheer came out of me when the credits rolled, although that cheer became a gag when I realized that they were going to play that godawful theme song. The Celine Dion croaks. You know, ""My Heart Will Go On.""How this film was nominated for fourteen Oscars is beyond me. Although, I hope people note that none of them were for acting. All About Eve, which held the record for most Oscar nods before this film slogged its way into the Oscars, is not a great film, and not worthy of 14 Oscar nods, but it's still eons better than this trash masquerading as a ""modern day classic"".This is one of those films that more people talk about than have actually seen. Just don't see it. Waste your time watching another movie instead. Like Casablanca, which is the SECOND most overrated love story of all time.This one is first.By the way, I love melodrama, and I am a teenage girl.",1/10
One of the best,Siobhan7485,10 April 2022,"Such a great movie with great actors, a great story, great cinematography and I think the visual effects still come across really well so they must have been amazing when it came out. I was good few years too young to watch Titanic when it first came out so when I finally got to watch it, it was the best day ever.. until the end. Absolutely devastated.. and I was for a long time too.However, I now (controversially) think the ending is actually perfect. As it is based on a real story, having happened in very different times (it may have played out very differently if it had happened in 1997 and this only becomes more true as time goes on) I think we needed to have our hearts broken to truly show us the sheer trauma many people would have experienced. Jack and Rose could not live happily ever after because that is not the reality of this story.All in all, the whole thing was just so brilliantly done and I am only taking a star off for the historical inaccuracies.",9/10
redeemed only by the effects,rupie,22 April 1999,"It is a sad commentary on contemporary taste that this movie has received so much critical and popular acclaim. It is redeemed only by its admittedly spectacular special effects. The acting of diCaprio & Winslet is sophomoric. The romantic storyline is improbable and saccharine. The Billy Zane role harks back to the ridiculous mustachioed villains of 19th century melodrama - laughably unbelievable. The score is a disgrace; a movie which aspires so high deserves a symphony orchestra and a John Williams, not the synthesized tin whistle effort it received. The portrayal of social class (everyone in First Class is an evil, repressed, sneering Capitalist Oppressor while everyone in Steerage is a vibrant, life-affirming peasant saint) is right out of a Marxist primer. diCaprio teaching Winslet to spit over the rail is both ridiculous and disgusting. And as for Cameron's ballyhooed fetish for historical accuracy, there is absolutely no evidence that any ship's officer committed suicide during the sinking (but it sure works great on screen, doesn't it?!). Further, he neglects to give a name to the infamous ship that lay 10 miles away and watched the Titanic sink while doing nothing (it was the Californian). And this is the 90's so we have to have our obligatory and gratuitous nude scene and sex scene, don't we (can't make a film without one nowadays)? Those with an interest in the Titanic (possible as a result of this movie) are directed to Walter Lord's incomparable book on the disaster ""A Night to Remember"", and the 1958 J.Arthur Rank production of the same name. Although the effects are not as great (it's 1958 after all) they stand up well, and the script, acting and whole tone of the movie are superior to this bloated and overrated ""blockbuster"". And those who glibly call this ""the best movie of all time"" are gently advised to go out and rent one or more from the following list - ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Spartacus"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Citizen Kane"". ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", ""Patton"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""The Quiet Man""....",4/10
Incredible,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,9 July 2018,"Adventurers delve to the bottom of the ocean to search the ghostly remains of the Titanic. It's a very haunting moment because it still rests at the bottom of the ocean this day. They find a safe with a drawing of a young woman wearing a ruby known as 'The Heart of the Ocean'. They get a call from a 100 year old lady claiming the drawing is her.There is great chemistry between Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio who both give great performances. It's a groundbreaking achievement from the gorgeous cinematography, sound effects and editing. It's a very immersive experience as there is so much attention to detail with the incredible set designs, costume designs and makeup giving it a very authentic look. James Horners sweeping music score is heartfelt and intense. James Cameron is a magnificent director who before this made action sci-fi blockbusters like the Terminator films and The Abyss. He proves that he is very versatile filmmaker who can make more than just action films. Its no surprise the film won 11 Oscars and became the highest grossing film ever made.",10/10

"Most Overrated Movie of All Time, as well as the Biggest Waste of Time",achsaphillippi8,26 March 2012,"To this day, I have been unable to figure out why people like this movie so much. It infuriates me how people are seduced by big-budget special effects and cheesy romance, and how they can't see past the eye candy to see that this movie had almost no true substance. James Cameron's good movies are The Terminator, Terminator 2, Aliens, and The Abyss. Titanic is not included in the list.The one good thing I will say about the movie is the special effects. The big turning machinery in the bottom of the ship, and the ship sinking and people falling all over the place was fun to watch, but got old very fast. Basically, the special effects were the only thing that made the movie. Another positive thing that I have to say about the movie is that Leonardo Dicaprio was the only character in the movie that I liked.Now on to the negatives of this movie, and bear with me because there are A LOT of them.I will start with the Romance. The romance aspect of the movie is probably what most people like about this movie, but believe me when I say it is one of the corniest, shallowest love stories I have ever suffered through (although it is not nearly as bad as Twilight). Jack, or Leonardo Dicaprio, is completely infatuated with Rose, or Kate Winslet. I mean, I can tell that she is pretty, but come on dude, you couldn't have picked a more selfish, emotionally imbalanced girl.Which brings me to the thing I probably will rave about the most: Kate Winslet's character Rose. I hated her. ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY HATED HER. She is a selfish, spoiled little brat, who in the beginning of the movie, decides to jump off the ship to kill herself simply because things are not going her way. As soon as she is out on the ledge outside the railing of the ship where she can't get back by herself (especially since she was smart enough to wear high-heels), she decides that she is too scared to go through with it, and has to have Jack save her sorry butt. So after a while, the movie drags on, and finally Jack declares his love for her. And all she does in response is that she tells him that she ""has to go, now."" Are you kidding me? If an amazingly cute boy declared his love for me, I'd at least thank him for his compliments! A lot later, Rose finally decides to fall in love with him, too. Alright, okay. But what about her fruitcake of a fianc√©e (who looked like he was wearing eye-liner)? Well, something else happens that infuriated me. The fianc√©e tries to make it look like Jack stole a diamond. This is at the point where Rose pretty much loves Jack, and trusts him with her life; so why didn't she defend him when the fianc√©e says he stole the diamond, and Jack asserts that he didn't do it, and brings up the fact that Rose knew him well enough to know that he didn't steal it? I don't know. She is an all-around moronic little skank. Also, I got irritated when she asks Jack to draw her naked. They've known each other for... two days? And she is already offering herself to him?! What is wrong with her??!! She was only seventeen!!! Ugh, the movie drags on and on and I get more and more annoyed until the end, (SPOLIER) when Jack dies (END OF SPOILER). It was horrifyingly disappointing to see the only good character in the movie die, and the most infuriating character live to tell the stupid tale! All in all, I would have given the movie two more stars if Rose had died, preferably by falling off the ship and into the propeller.All the other characters, except for Jack, I hated, though not as much as I hated Rose. Her mother was a straight-up b-word. Her fianc√©e was a total fruitcake, and a mean fruitcake at that. Every other background character was flat, and unmemorable. The acting was so cheap, and I really couldn't feel any sympathy for any of the characters, even when they drowned and froze to death, which is indeed terrible, but I don't care. When I don't like the characters or the movie in general, I always wish for the movie to end with all of them dying.Besides being an overblown Hollywood special effects showcase, some smaller details of the movie seemed a little far-fetched. First of all, The elderly woman in the beginning was there at the Titanic when she was 17. That was in 1912. It is now 1997 in the movie. That would make her 102 years old. One hundred and two, and still living on her own and taking care of herself? Is that even possible? Also, how did the drawing of her naked survive all those years underwater? One last thing: the treasure hunters in the beginning of this three-hour movie ask the old lady where the Diamond is, and she tells this long stupid story, only to pull out the necklace from her drawer at the end of the movie. Why didn't the stupid hag give it to them in the very beginning?? What was the point of that three-hour, cheesy, infuriating, boring, stupid story??!!When I heard this movie was being re-released in 3D, I felt the rage at this movie coming up again. I don't care if I'm the only one who absolutely LOATHED this movie. All I know is that I know what a good movie is, and Titanic is NOT a good movie.",1/10
What an awful movie!,erg,22 June 1999,"SO much hype. The acting was just terrible. People flocked to this movie like sheep. The dialogue was so contrived, how could people not notice? It is a shame this movie is seen as ""romantic"", rather than as the monstrosity it is.",1/10
just press the fast forward button,clare2888,24 December 2000,"Watched it on the screen a few years back and could not sleep that night. I couldn't stop thinking about the poor people who drowned.The plot was not as interesting to me until the Titanic started to sink then the mood started to pick up.  i'm sorry that the characters were too one-dimensional to make me feel sorry for them when they drowned,  Kept wishing i knew more about them before they pulled the plug on the everything. . .I watched the documentary on cable channel then spurred me on to borrow the video.  The documentary made me cry more than the movie, amazingly. Watching it on video, I could watch the sinking bit 100 times, its the best! I just fast forward the whole middle section of the movie and watch the start and ending.  I can truly imagine myself sinking with the thousand plus desperate people, the special effects are truly convincing and fabulous! I cheered for the single lifeboat which went back and wonder what were the real stories of the 6 people whom they rescued?I'm very interested in discovering the stories of all the survivors and what really happened to the people who were on the Titanic because of this movie's attempts to recreate that fatal night.

"The most breathtaking love story ever! MUCH better than ""Gone With The Wind""",chrisbishop5000,1 December 2006,"This film is underrated and yet so beautiful! In 1997, the world was introduced to a heartbreaking, uplifting film which provides you 3 hours and 20 minutes or so with romance, adventure, danger, the spirit of kindness, offering the person you love your own life (just like Jack Dawson did for Rose). I ask you - what more can a movie give you? Tell me that! Even the scenes like when Rose takes off her clothes and Jack draws her naked, and the moderate/strong bad language which comes in frequently doesn't put me off. I think the certificate should've been 15+. I personally do not think the mature sequences in this movie are suitable for a big kid aged 12. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are the our stars in this outstanding epic. Their characters are far from similar because Rose is rich and she mixes with snobby people and yet she doesn't like them at all and she's also feisty. Jack is poor and likes to hang out with his mates and despite his rough edges, he has a heart of gold! He is such a loving, selfless young man who even took his own life. Anyway, when Rose can't put up with being somebody she doesn't want, she bolts out of Titanic's main restaurant and attempts to commit suicide by jumping off the ship. Jack sees what she's doing and insists that she doesn't drop off the railing. At first she tells him to goaway, but he holds out his hand and she gives him her hand. She slips and nearly falls into the sea. He uses all his strength to lift her back onto the boat. From then, they gradually fall in love with each other. This feature-film makes me cry big tears every time I see it. I sob in the same way a person would do if they were mourning the death of a loved one. I feel as if I may not stop crying for at least an hour after the film finishes. Even some of the scenes that aren't sad make me cry. Like; when Jack feels upset when Rose tries to avoid him because she's engaged to Cal Hockley (a heartless and violent man) just to please him but the evening of the day when she tells him not to keep seeing her she has a sudden change of mind and comes to see him at the front of ""Titanic"". He reaches for her hand and tells her to step up onto the railing, let her arms spread out while he supports her and then she believes she's flying and at that point they kiss. It's shot beautifully against evening pink skies - it's just so tearful, knowing this couple are sharing their final evening together and- (Sniffles). Rose says to Jack ""Jack when the ship docks, I'm getting off with you!"", sadly, what I say is ""you mean IF the ship docks!"" and from there all the tragedy of Titanic's collision into the iceberg will come in in only a short matter of time. When it happens Jack is held prisoner right at the bottom of the ship and they leave him there even when the ship is sinking! Luckily, Rose comes to his rescue and releases him. Then, as Rose is rich and Jack is poor, Rose is forced to board a boat and as it lowers he hand which is holding Jack's is pulled away. Cal Hockley menacingly says to Jack as she leaves, ""I always win, Jack"" - uh, not this time buster! But she leaps off the lifeboat and runs to his arms. He runs to her, too, and that's also too emotional to be true. But there's more tragedy to come. When the entire ship sinks to the bottom, after ""the ship's arse snaps"" as that man said at the beginning, Jack and Rose spot a board afloat but it's too small for them BOTH, so very selflessly, Jack lifts her onto the board and he stays in the freezing water. ""You have got to promise me that you'll survive, that you'll make babies and watch them grow. Promise me, Rose, that you'll die a little old lady warm in her bed. But not here, not this night! That divorce was the best thing that ever happened to me it brought me to you. Please, make me that promise."" He kisses her hand for the last time. Rose later tells Jack there's a boat to save them - but he doesn't answer or even move. He has frozen to death. Rose cannot believe it but bravely lets him sink; now I know I'll cry! WHAT A SAD MOVIE!!! But, despite its trauma, ""Titanic"" is irresistible. Over 15s won't be able to help but succumb to its beauty. Far better than the offensive ""Gone with the Wind"". Rose may be feisty but she's certainly not a self-obsessed harpy like Scarlett O'Hara and Jack Dawson is anything but that arrogant cad Rhett Butler, the womanising scumbag! Titanic is VERY underrated and ""Gone With The Wind"" is VERY overrated - absurd but, cest la vie!Gloria Stuart was 86 when she starred as old Rose and with this film she is most associated. Her final film was ""Lands of Plenty"" in 2004. The following year, she contracted cancer but had always appeared well to the public eye. She also looked frail in her old age. James Cameron attended her 100th birthday. For a moment I thought she'd live forever! I am deeply saddened to report that Gloria Stuart died of cancer last Sunday. She was 100 years old. God love her! I showed my mother a beautiful tribute to her on Youtube and she revealed that she could feel Gloria's energy around me, she felt her there. Apparently she put her arm round me then blew me a kiss goodbye.A divine and inspirational woman...GLORIA STUART4th July 1910-26th September 2010",10/10
CONE ICUS REVIEW OF TITANIC!!,coneicus,25 April 2021,"AS A PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOPATH LIKE MYSELF, I FELL IN LOVE WITH JACK AND ROSE.

Complete perfection,rachelob_7,30 August 2007,"I saw the hype of this movie and immediately thought it would be too much, and I decided not to see it in theatres. I made a huge mistake. In 2001, I saw it on television and couldn't believe it. This movie has an amazing script that kept me watching. The love story made me sigh and cry! Not saying what happens! Even though most people already know. Might be spoilers ahead! Anyways, the Jack and Rose story was enough for me, but after Titanic hit the iceberg it was like a completely different movie! I loved how they kept the love story ""afloat"" (haha) while the ship was sinking. There are so many elements to this movie that I can't even explain. Every time I watch it, I cry for Jack. Every single time. The fact that he loved her enough to sacrifice his life.. Wow. I mean, I can't get a man to open a door for me! Let alone, give me the door to float on while he freezes to death! That's love. The way this film plays out is amazing. All the special effects, the costumes, the acting! Don't even get me started about the acting! And even things right down to the sound the Lookout's bell makes. But.. I have to say, after the 80th time I watched the movie (or around there somewhere) I started to notice that some of the lines are just a little bit TOO cheesy. But that really is the only flaw in the 194 minutes of perfection. Some people I know won't watch the film because of the long running time. But I think if it was any shorter I wouldn't be satitsfiyed. i really wouldn't. All in all, this movie is beautiful. It makes me feel things I almost never feel.Complete perfection",9/10
"Flawed, but with a touch of the sublime.",ted puff,26 September 1999,"An extraordinary interest still exists in Cameron's film, still argument rages over just how good it is. The timing of its release was significant, the obsession with the film might be explained as a form of pre millennial tension at the close of the most murderous century the human race has known, a century which began with such hope and optimism, and in which the Titanic was ironically such a proud symbol. 'A Night to remember' was released amid worries about the Bomb and the feeling that science was again out of control. 'Titanic' amid millennial jitters. The most discussed aspect is the script, there are lines in the film that are moronic, irritating, senseless and just plain dumb. Others were quoted from the U.S.Senate Enquiry, which proves how people then had a better command of language than we do. Why do Jack and Rose board at Southampton when they've come from Paris? Why doesn't the diamond fall out of Rose's pocket going down with a sinking ship? Why doesn't she find it in her pocket on the Carpathia before reaching New York? Why is it that you can be rude to the ship's owner, assault and abuse the staff, 'fly' from an offlimits bow, run through boiler rooms and cargo holds, cause two stewards looking for you to drown, distract the lookouts, climb in and out of lifeboats, damage property, and NEVER get into trouble? Why do the steerage accept rich snooty first class gatecrashing their party? Why, why, why?Too much time is spent on the wrapping footage, though the unseen sunken interiors are breathtaking. The taste of showing the Titanic sinking like a computer game in front of a survivor isn't questioned. The dissolve of the wreck into the pristine ship packs an emotional wallop every time. Winslet isn't a great actress, she plays the same in every film. On Leo, when Titanic leaves port in a classic series of images, we feel his joy. But it's downhill from here.The engine room montage is another classic, but it's looking artificial. Murdoch's feet are all over the deck. The ship looks like it's populated by the Thunderbirds.Relief, Victor Garber arrives as Thomas Andrews and gives the dialogue meaning, conviction, dignity and charm, quite a feat since thanks to Cameron's warped priorities he only speaks two lines. A thing apparent in Rose is how lacking in charm she is, lighting up at table, and indelicate. No Edwardian. And as this film isn't subtle, but whacks you on the head and biffs you in the stomach we must have the class speech straight away. Tommy Ryan is the most irritating character I've seen on screen and completely unlike any Irish I've met. The next situation isn't credible. Isn't there a better way of introducing these two than the unbelievable jumping off the stern. There is one good line in the dull walk and talk that a first class wench would have said 'This is MY part of the ship' huffs Rose. But with the spit scene any hopes of a romantic wallow are dead.The cheek of the dinner party is how Jack Dawson, somebody who if Rose had chopped his hand off with the axe, would have been pushed to earn a living, has the temerity to lecture a brilliant engineer, a captain with 40 years experience and captains of industry on how to live life, when he hasn't started shaving himself. We need a unmaterialistic message in films, even if it would come better from a director who hadn't overspent his budget by $100million. But the portrayal of rich and poor is straight out of a propaganda film for the gulag.It's a pity, there is such a brilliant Irish band on board, and there aren't equally brilliant dancers.Whether the film has a Christian message at the core or if it's proclaiming that doing your own thing is more important, it's hard to say. The divine service was open to all classes so Jack being turned away is misleading and pointless. A stunning scene on the bow but there hasn't been a romantic exchange yet between this couple that convinces us. Such models of taste and discernment and the brightest thing they say about Monet is that his use of colour is extraordinary. The funniest line in film history: 'This is a ship, only so many places she could be'. The next shot: Titanic bowling merrily along. A thousand rooms!The iceberg finally turns up, the collision is breathtaking, the acting top notch and inseparable from the historical event even if Titanic hits the only iceberg in the whole Atlantic. The surreal party with music and lifejackets shows Cameron can write. Sometimes. But Jack manacled up is tedious and the crew wouldn't have done that on a sinking ship. The real story is lost in Rose running around. The lifeboats when we see them are done far better than any other version, and the timeline makes perfect sense.Titanic alone and helpless, a tiny ship with a futile rocket in an empty ocean is inspired. The film takes on a different dimension and has a touch of the sublime. The images that accompany the hymn are elegiac and perfect. The choreography around the last two boats can't be surpassed. Now we do feel a sense of the panic and despair. The water through the dome, a baptism of fire. No one can fail to be moved by the 20 minutes of terrible destruction. The lifeboat scenes couldn't have been done better, and the Carpathia is a painting brought to life. How exactly Rose retains her incognito through the years when she's a publicized actress, an aviator and everything else in the known universe isn't explained. The ending is a straight pinch from 'Somewhere in time' which did a better job of a love story set in 1912. The frustrating thing is how many things ARE done well. There are gems of writing and acting. It looks terrific. But it proves that you can recreate the cutlery, carpets, staterooms, clothes, but it's so much harder to recreate history. It isn't 1912. And half the film isn't Titanic.",7/10
Hyped or Hated,VictorianCushionCat,19 January 2012,"Looking at all the reviews before mine, it seems that Titanic either is hated or loved to the extreme either way. My verdict is that it's very entertaining as a mindless special effects fest but as a Titanic enthusisast for some years before it's release can find much fault.Firstly it's historically poor, key to this is the scene where Officer Murdoch shoots a passenger then shoots himself, after taking bribe money. My problem here is that this Officer Murdoch actually existed and is it really fair 85 years on to make out that he got up to such business? Another gripe is the script and acting, it's terrible, not least some of the lines between Winslett and De Caprio. Somehow all the actors seem to be too uncomfortable to deliver their lines naturally. Much as I approve of seeing a 1930s era actress in a late 90s blockbuster (Gloria Stuart) I really can't stand her dialogue delivery, I assume they had called Fay Wray first.There are positives, the sinking is exciting enough, in other words good special effects, which seems to be enough for some people. I even rather like the very final scene, where Rose is reunited with all the people on the ship who died, but to call this the best film ever is perhaps going a wee bit too far.Perhaps having seen both 'Titanic 1952' with a very well throughout family tradigy, and the more documentary style 'Night to Remember 1958' I was never going to fall in love with James Cameron's effort, I reckon Kenneth More would of told him where he could stick the line 'I'll shoot you all like dogs' One more moan, 'De Witt Buckator' Most unintentionally awful movie name ever!",5/10
"Epitome of badly written, overbudgeted trash",jehan21,13 March 2008,"This movie, despite the inordinate quantity of rewards it received, combines clich√©s and stilted dialogue to produce a passable effort. However, the length makes it excessively tedious. The script was badly written to the extent that the high points of the movie were the mammeries of Kate Winslet and the death of Leonardo's character, which provides some elation as the movie is, at that point, bound to roll the credits and leave you in piece. The special effects were an achievement, but the nauseating level of self-conscious sentimentalism that underpinned the movie burdened these scenes and leave you wondering why you should be compelled to care. The overall message is the same ""love conquers all"" message with a very familiar method. Highly recommended for those who suffer insomnia.",3/10
A masterpiece,kirviti,26 January 2023,"Titanic... the 25 year old masterpiece that I watched way too late. But the moment I watched it I completely fell in love with it. This movie is the one that made me a fan of James Cameron. Starting with the visuals, the sets, costumes, cinematography which were breathtaking and way ahead of their time. What's not to love about this movie? It has everything you can think of...love, drama, humour, visuals, emotions. Just perfect. It also had some really funny moments which I didn't expect but it was cool. Though for me the best part of the movie is the music which is just....heavenly. And then there is the song ""My Heart Will Go on"" which has become my favourite song and is truly magical. This whole movie is a timeless classic, filled with magic that can never be replicated again and only James Cameron could have made it. It will remain in my heart forever. 11/10.",10/10

But it's still a good film. In comparison to the cinematic garbage that is being churned out of Hollywood today, Titanic is a landmark production. The two making the film as excellent as it is are both James Cameron and James Horner. The scenes are well done, the music fitted excellently to them, and the acting is done finely. Titanic is a *good* movie.",10/10
"Historically Inaccurate, Terrible",full_meddle_jacket,13 February 2002,"Aside from being widely historically inaccurate (the whole ""Are there enough lifeboats?"" thing--nobody asked that question on that ship, numerous other flukes), the film was horribly written and badly acted. Depended too heavily on Leonardo DeCaprio's brief rise to superstardom among 13 year old girls (whatever happened to that guy?). But it won a buccoo amount of Oscars, and this is just my opinion. But still, the sheer naive sense of it detracts from the entire film. --Bud Sturguess, Texas",1/10
Too much emphasis on a love story,linda-frances,16 July 2019,"I live in Southampton, the city where Jack and Rose embarked on the ill-fated Titanic. Many of the crew and the captain himself were from Southampton, many women were widowed and children left fatherless when the ship went down. It was a major tragedy for our city and my children went to school with children who descended from those who lost their lives. I felt a certain lack of respect was shown at times for the English crew, portrayed as bumbling and rude and this is unfair to the families left behind. Having said that the film was spectacular and I don't begrudge the love story of Jack and Rose, but when the ship started sinking I wasn't interested in seeing Cal chase the lovers through the ship, more attention should of been given to the disaster itself, the other people on board, but I still give it an 8 cos it made me cry.",8/10
Perfect,vfdzprsyd,26 January 2023,"All time classic. Perfect mix of action and emotion.The effects are still good even watching now in 2023. The beautiful soundtrack makes it even better and I never get bored of watching this movie.There is nothing I can really fault about it and it's definitely one of my favourite movies.Rose as a character is a little annoying at times and spoilt. She definitely made her own life a lot harder than it had to be at times.Also to fall in love after a few days is a little unbelievable but other than that it is real very good if you overlook a few small things. Overall, still brilliant to this day.",10/10
"Reminds Me of an Episode of ""Quantum Leap""",aesgaard41,27 January 2001,"Voice of Dean Stockwell as Admiral Al Calavicci: ""Sam, Ziggy says you've leapt into one Jack Dawson of Chippewa Falls,Michigan and that there's a 78.5% chance that you're here to save the life of one Rose Dewitt Bukater."" Well, at least that's the way I see it. I may not see Scott Bakula or Stockwell, but for some reason I get the feeling that behind DeCaprio's pretty boy looks, it is Bakula as time-traveler Sam Beckett pulling his strings. I can just hear Stockwell after the nude drawing: ""You drew that while she was.....And I missed it?! Rats!!"" Back to the movie, it may be a chick flick for girls to see Leo, but it does have Kate Winslet for the guys. She looks incredible with red hair! Billy Zane should get an award for the sheer arrogance he plays (maybe it comes naturally) and David Warner should get the Jerk Reward for his portrayal as Zane's stooge. Exceptionally talented Kathy Bates is wonderfully likeable as Molly Brown, a far cry from her ""Misery"" role, but then she does excellant work in everything she does. Cameron pays a lot of detail into this work, or not considering the bloopers constantly being nick-picked. The story of two lovers separated by fate works well against the tragedy of the Titanic's sinking as does telling it from a past point of view at the site of a salvage expedition with Bill Paxton. I haven't seen him since ""Wierd Science."" The sinking is very well done. We just don't see a miniature sinking as have we seen in so many other movies, we see the drowning, the suffering, the deck going up, the sheer terror and true nature of the human spirit when faced with its mortality, the people fighting for life boats......this is the movie to put an end to further Titanic movies. Cameron has put together here not just an incredibly powerful movie, but a chick flick that even guys would want to see!",10/10
stop crying!!,tammyshadowkilljoy,30 June 2010,"I really hate the titanic. Yes, it's full of romance. Yes, it's a real life tragedy.

It's not that good and no, i did not cry. Ghost made me cry. Bambi made me cry. Reading true life accounts of what happened on the titanic made me cry. But the film? It is so bad that i cried more at Marley and Me! I wish that they'd just hurry up and get to the part where the ship sinks. Honestly. They completely romanticised a terrible event.

Why?,geiiga42,1 June 1999,"Perhaps this was a good movie, as so many seem to think. I would tend to disagree. James Cameron, for whatever good qualities he may have, is not an Oscar-caliber director. The script was shoddy (Proper girl runs away from her betrothed and gets dirty with a street urchin. Street urchin is properly glorified and the betrothed vilified), and the acting was subpar (the only character I actually liked was the ship's designer). That leaves this movie with what every other James Cameron flick has: special effects. Unfortunately, they're not great enough to redeem the three hours plus this movie takes to endure.  I was looking at my watch more than the screen when I first saw it, and I'd point anyone who wants to see this movie to films that deserved an Oscar but didn't receive one due to the Academy's buying the hype.",1/10
"The ""unsinkable"" ship that was destined to sink",Atreyu_II,12 July 2007,"""Titanic"" is not only the most famous disaster film of all time, but also one of the most popular movies ever, not to mention that it achieved the rare glory of wining 11 Academy Oscars. Many ""Titanic"" films were made during the 20th century, but the famous James Cameron film from 1997 is the most well known.This film version of the legendary ship was a phenomenal and unusual success, so much that it was something like 7 months on theaters and proved to be the most cost-effective movie ever made. Many people even went to the theaters twice to see it. And the number of Academy Oscars that it won is another prove of its success. Plus, most everyone praised and liked the film back then. It was a hit on VHS and DVD as well.Strangely, in recent years the movie has been getting many lukewarm reviews and I read somewhere in the Internet that it was considered the worst Oscar winner ever. How ironic, huh? It seems that it has become fashionable to hate this movie.It's an okay movie, but not all that great. However, my biggest problem with the movie was always its length. 3 hours is too much and becomes tiring, even exhausting.The story is well known for being based in a real disaster story which happened in 1912. That makes this a realistic movie. The ship's replica is very well made and detailed. In that way they achieved perfection, making it look just like the real ship, which was the biggest, fastest, most luxurious and most beautiful of its time. Sadly it hit an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage and more than half of the people passed away. You know what bothers me most? First, the number of lifeboats wasn't enough because, stupidly, they believed that more lifeboats would be a waste of space in an ""unsinkable"" ship. Unsinkable? Yeah, right... Second, the ship was going too fast when its engines hadn't been tested enough... and all of this just because of headlines!""Titanic"" has beautiful instrumental music, a beautiful ballad named ""My Heart Will Go On"" sung by Celine Dion, beautiful angles of view of that pretty ship, romance, tension, suspense and incredibly tragic moments. To see people falling in despair and committing suicide is a reality and it certainly happened in real life. This movie also contains some nudity and sex and even some shocking and controversial scenes of homicide. However, it's not just a melodrama. It has also romance and even some moments of comedy.Besides, to see the Titanic sinking, breaking in two and to see its rear at an impressing height is breathtaking. It will live forever in your mind because it's very impressive. Spectacular, yes, but tragic.The actors do a good job in their roles: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Victor Garber, Danny Nucci, Jason Barry, Bernard Fox and others...By the way, Mr. Andrews, Jack Dawson, Fabrizio and Tommy Ryan are the best and nicest characters of this movie.Another equally revolutionary ship was the french ocean liner SS Normandie in the 30's. Its appearance was very similar to the RMS Titanic and inside it followed the same concept of luxury in a classic and old fashioned style, very different from the luxury standards of modern liners. The SS Normandie didn't sink, but its ending was tragic too. During the World War II, it was was converted to a troopship in 1942, caught fire, capsized and sank at the New York Passenger Ship Terminal. Although it was salvaged at great expense, restoration of the vessel was deemed too expensive, so it was scrapped in 1946. And I say ""it"" because I don't like to refer to the ships as ""she"".",6/10
This film never sinks.,sheepmonk2000,5 June 2011,"This film never sinks. From the opening few shots to the final moments of the film, everything about it is simply wonderful. It's majestic, charming, sweet, thrilling, suspenseful and most of all heart wrenching. The pacing of the film is perfect and the special effects towards the end of the film are also top notch. The story is about two young lovers Jack and Rose. It really is a beautiful love story as we see them overcoming the odds in order to be together. But don't be put off by the love story element, as there's plenty of action and excitement come the second half of the film and the film never sinks for one moment. Like I said, the pacing is perfect and I must say this is probably the greatest story telling ever put to celluloid - James Camerons a genius. All the actors/actresses are great, but for me it's Leonardo DiCaprio's movie as his character Jack, demonstrates his self worth at every turn and goes to extraordinary lengths in order for him and Rose to be together and ultimately stay together i.e survive the catastrophe that may fore-go their destinies.

"Bad start,then gets much better",kenandraf,27 November 2000,"The start was very Disney like.Very bad dialogue and very condescending.But I was patient and I found the movie turning into gold with every passing minute starting with the scene where Leonardo was dining with the rich people,then from then on the film just kept impressing me.The movie started loosing it's Disney compromises with every minute passing.This movie could have been perfect with a better start,particularly with the dialogue.But after all the positive things this movie has shown,it has my blessings as a bonafide classic.Very depressing though.Very sad story but that was intended and the love story had it's power thru the tragedies around it.One would expect tragedy with a movie regarding this sort of historical disaster anyhow.It reminds me of another romantic movie with a very tragic ending that I love which is ""A Place In The Sun"" with Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift.But I accepted the tragic end of that one becouse it was made clear that Clift confessed to murder in one form or another.But Leonardo in this movie was such a gallant heroic young man that it depresses us to see him end that way.I'm not a nut for depressing romantic movies but I can appreciate them.This movie won me in the end.It also had one of the most suspensefull scenes I have ever seen.I was literally sweating and could hardly contain myself when Leonardo was being rescued from those handcuffs!This movie had that classic magic indeed.........",10/10
"Commercially, a titanic success, great direction, but...",RJBurke1942,31 August 2006,"Before this film, the director, James Cameron was best known for action thrillers such as Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss and True Lies ¬ñ all of which delivered the goods for action fans. After sitting through Titanic, however, I think he should have stayed with the true action-thriller genre, because when you mix genres, you can get mixed results. And, in this case, it shows...The story of the Titanic is well known: an 'unsinkable' ship sinks on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912 with most of the male passengers dying. Cameron, using the technical wizardry he'd perfected in his earlier works, made you feel as though you were actually there, instead of being a mere spectator; the special effects are truly stunning. For action fans, that aspect of the film is relatively brief, however, because the bulk of the film and the very contrived plot are more concerned with the recovery of a fabulous jewel ¬ñ a symbol of love -- from the existing wreck, left there by the heroine, Rose (Kate Winslet) with her all too brief lover, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) who perishes as the ship sinks. How the two lovers come together in the film and how the jewel comes to have so much significance forms the basis of the plot; the details of the sub-plot ¬ñ the actual events leading to and including the sinking -- are mere props to the overall story of first love. The metaphor is thus complete ¬ñ as the ship sinks on its first voyage, so also first love sinks.All of that is explored in flashback, as a burgeoning love between two people who would not otherwise have met, anytime, anywhere else. So the actual loss of the Titanic is, in that sense, incidental to the greater loss suffered by each and every person who lost a loved one in that tragedy. To that extent, the film succeeds in its presentation but only because of the calibre of the acting. As an account of the tragedy of the Titanic, however, it's a misnomer and a failure; while, as entertaining escapism ¬ñ well, as the saying goes -- nothing succeeds like excess.To find out how the tragic event actually happened, you'd be better off getting a copy of A Night To Remember (1958) from your video store instead.",5/10
"Good detail, tragic yet slightly cheasy",eiebog,11 April 2000,"Titanic is a fairly good movie, but I personally think the historical part of the movie seemed to be more touching and overall better then the love story between Jack and Rose. Their relationship seemed to have all of the aspects that every Hollywood romantic-fantasy has: the two young lovers are breaking the social code to be seeing each other, they're both young enough to pass as teenagers..(which, in this film, I think they are) , there is a steamy scene, and it has a touch of tragedy. Well, it's all very predictable but James Cameron did a wonderful job with the story of the ship Titanic. I found that part more touching and realistic than the love story. You really can see the passenger's terror and panic during the sinking sequence. Its all very saddening to watch because, as you watch it, you know that it actually happened many years ago. The amount of detail put into it was incredible, from the ""woman and children first, first class first"" to the musicians staying aboard to play, the fireworks... all very nice to watch.",No Rating
Not very impressive....,Marcey13,15 September 1998,"I'd like to say that 'Titanic' only got it's attention because Leonardo DiCaprio was in it and it was the most expensive movie. It was nothing like the real sinking of the Titanic, and they made too many mistakes, which you will notice if you watch carefully. I'm a fan of Camerons work, but this was simply an attention seeker movie, like 'Godzilla'. It shouldn't have gotten all the Oscars because there were better movies, with much better standards. The only Oscars it deserved to win was best song, and best music, which was the only good thing about this movie. If you wanna see a real masterpiece see 'Good Will Hunting' or 'Sliding Doors'. For those who haven't seen it, see it but don't expect the best, expect an average disaster movie.",8/10
A colossal filmmaking achievement,FlickJunkie-2,31 August 2000,"At over $1.8 Billion worldwide (excluding rentals), `Titanic' is the most commercially successful film of all time.  That is double the next highest grossing film (Star Wars: The Phantom Menace).  Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it won 11 including best picture in 1998.  Everything about this film was big.  It ran over 3 hours and had a budget of $200 million which is larger than the U.S. box office for all but 30 movies in the history of filmmaking.  This was a TITANIC film in every sense of the word.  But, was it any good?  Well, actually it was!The film was written and directed by James Cameron, who before this was most renowned for writing and directing `Terminator' films.  The story was a combination love story, period piece and disaster movie.  As a love story was good.  As a period piece, it was wonderfully precise in its myriad details, both generally and as to specifics about the Titanic and her passengers.  As an epic disaster movie, it was utterly colossal.From a directorial perspective, this film is unparalleled; a feat of gargantuan proportions.  In addition to the normal directorial duties, Cameron had to coordinate mammoth model-building projects, deep sea filming of the original ship, thousands of hours of painstaking research, elaborate visual effects, and hundreds of special sets.  To be able to pull all those elements together at all is a superhuman task.  The result was truly remarkable entertainment.Cameron took a chance on Leonardo DiCaprio.  The studios wanted Matthew McConaughey but Cameron insisted on DiCaprio.  It was a gamble that paid off.  DiCaprio gave a career performance and his enthusiasm and charm lit up the screen.  Kate Winslet was also a fresh talent with only five minor films to her credit before ¬ëTitanic'.  Her performance was sparkling and her chemistry with DiCaprio made the love story urgent and magical.  Oddly, she hasn't worked much since, and is fast slipping back into the obscurity from whence she came.This was not as much a film as it was a fluctuation in the space-time continuum.  Forces and emotions from the original event were transported to 1997, and they clutched us with a power that left us spellbound.  It was neither the best story ever told, nor the best film ever made, but it was certainly the greatest filmmaking achievement to date in its sheer size and scope.  As a motion picture, I rated it a 9/10.  As an epic, there is no scale large enough to rate it.  The box office speaks for itself.",9/10
The worst and most over rated movie of all time,Baby-28,3 September 1999,"Titanic is the most over rated movie, I think of the decade. It contains boaring scenes, bad acting on the part of Leo, and unbelivable romances. I don't understand why this movie was so loved. Young girls may enjoy Leo, but I feel that he is totally over rated and a horrible actor. When I first saw him in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, he was remarkable. What happened? I must admit that the special effects were great, but a movie can't ride on effects alone. Especially when it's 3 hours long. I thought it would never end. Lets get over Leo's cute little face and be true to our selves.",1/10
"A historic event, sprinkled with some love dust",0w0,4 February 2020,"This movie is a romantic film, set in the backdrop of the historic sinking of the cruise ship named ""Titanic"". Even if you're not that into romantic movies, this movie still packs enough action and suspense to keep you from falling asleep. The CGI for the time was bleeding-edge and the fact that it was the biggest budget movie ever for its time truly shows. The movie is a spectacle and it's done extremely well.The performances for Leo de Caprio and Kate Winslet isn't anything special but they still deliver believable performances as does the entire cast.Even more than 20 years later, the movie is still extremely watchable and I honestly can't think of a better portrayal of the historic sinking of this massive ship. From the systematic flooding of the cabins below deck to the breaking and snapping of the entire ship into two pieces, its all done extremely well and it all seems very true-to-fact.Overall an amazing cinematic experience and an even better portrayal of an historic event.",9/10
A sterile example of post-modernism......,gus81,15 January 2005,"Well, this certainly put bums on seats. Great special effects, great cinematography, nudity, steamy sex scene, spitting competitions, shoot-outs, and a tragic ending to a beautiful love story - all aboard the S.S Titanic! This makes for, I'd say, the worse of the well-known Titanic movies. It had a much bigger budget and such better special effects, but for extreme lack of sincerity and authenticity it is by far the worse. The producers actually seemed to make an effort - in some parts at least - to include 1990s attitudes into a 1912 setting: note the rude finger Kate Winslet gave to the antagonist while escaping down the lift.Kudos to James Cameron for putting so much effort into building the actual ship from original blueprints and for focusing so much attention on realistic FX, and making the film, in parts, so profoundly historically accurate. But in those parts in which the film was not profoundly accurate, it was profoundly the opposite and disgustingly so. Shame on Cameron for making the focus of the film a soppy, clich√©d love story; the kind of which we have seen dozens of times. And shame for making those scenes which were historically and poignantly accurate mere backdrops to this standard and fictionalised love story.But in our times, this kind of lowest-common-denominator love story puts bums on seats and millions forked out to see Winslet and DiCaprio fall in love, ride on the bow, and finally say a tearful, inopportune, goodbye.This is the failure of the movie. It is anachronistic, and the film voids itself off. On one hand, spending millions on accuracy - sets, research, costumes and special effects - will attract many people looking forward to good quality film-making and a solid telling of what happened that night - people who will then be alienated by the no-brainer love story. On the other hand, the assumed target audience of the film who are primarily excited by the love story are those who could not care less about the millions spent on historical accuracy. It is a totally anachronistic situation.James Cameron totally wasted a fantastic opportunity to make a brilliant film on the subject, a film that could have surpassed all previous efforts. Instead he devised a storyline totally entrenched in Hollywood love-story stereotype, of the type that anyone could see anywhere else, and simply set this aboard a historically accurate rendition of the Titanic. He did not understand that the real events alone of April 14-15 1912 were enough to fuel a heart-breaking story of tragedy and bitter irony, and instead he used well-worn cinematic tools to pitch the film at the lowest-common-denominator who can't be bothered thinking outside their own experience. 'Titanic' is just an example of the cultural sterility of our times. The 1958 film 'A Night to Remember' told a more genuine, authentic, touching and historically accurate version of the disaster with half the budget and half the special effects technology, and I think this is testament to the suburban teenage wasteland which is Cameron's film.Still, the film offers good old-fashioned movie-going thrills and spills. It has a classic format against-the-odds love story all. It also has great special effects, and employs intelligent cinematography. So as a form of entertainment, it is a jolly good romp to accompany a bag of popcorn. As a film about the Titanic - which it purports to be - well, this kind of story could have been set anywhere and at anytime. The Titanic merely made a good and exciting setting for the fictional characters involved.This is a bad Titanic film, and as James Cameron was aspiring to make a Titanic film, hence the title, he has failed. As time, the harshest critic of all, marches on the film will be seen more and more as a marketing vehicle of the late 1990s. Other, better, Titanic productions will remain holding their own as honest, accurate and sincere renditions of what really happened that night.Finally, the above-mentioned remarks about the anachronistic nature of the film make it difficult to rate, and hence the love-it-or-hate-it experience of this film. 'Titanic' straddles the ridge between well researched triumph and Hollywood farce with the dexterity of a three-legged elephant....Which ever direction the elephant falls is up to each individual viewer.",1/10
Best movie ever,ynfvbfwmc,27 October 2022,I have watched this probably at LEAST 200 times. I know the dialogue like the back of my hand and I'm just obsessed. My friends and my husband get so tired of titanic and me blaring my heart will go on and belt it out like it's the first time I've heard it. They never watch it with me but I could literally watch it everyday twice a day. Leo was at his hottest and the fashion is so glorious and the dress rose wears during the sinking is so iconic and beautiful.

Rooting for the Iceberg,friend_of_harry_lime,11 June 2006,"Aimed precisely at those with the emotional maturity of 13-year-old children, Titanic, while technically impressive, is perhaps the most overrated tripe to float out of Hollywood's shipyard of overblown hype. Here you have perhaps the worst single tragedy of the 20th century, and, what do we get? -- A phony, forced, class struggle ""love"" story so poorly written that no one with half a brain cares one whit about the characters. Obviously, the producers of this shipwreck of a film assume that the public is too dull to let the sheer drama of the event itself sustain the story, so we're assaulted by perhaps the worst script ever written. Not only is there not one once of truthful human emotion in the screenplay, it's insulting as well. The Poseidon Adventure, as trite as it was, had more veracity than this muddle.Titanic will lower your IQ, guaranteed, and probably cause warts too. If you need to see a film about this fateful night that actually treats its audience like an adult, rent A Night to Remember, a vastly superior film.Two stars for technical achievement only.",2/10
Mediocre at Best,Foot_Freakin_Master,4 January 2005,"I was so excited at the prospect of seeing Titanic. I anxiously waited for the film to begin. By the end, I knew that I never wanted to see it again. What a disappointment.I suppose the special effects and set design were great. Perhaps some of the scenes were enjoyable. But the acting was only so so. The story was lame, the romance banal. The Billy Zane character was a true joke. Plus, so much of the movie lacked credibility. Wouldn't the character played by Kate surely have drowned before being able to be rescued? An overlong study in mediocrity at best. James Cameron gave us a dud.I admit some of my disdain is in response to the great marketing rush. I feel as though the movie was being jammed down my throat.

An Amazing Emotional Example of Good Film-making,FilmFanInTheHouse,9 November 2007,"Titanic (1997, Dir. James Cameron) Brock Lovett whilst investigating the wreckage of the Titanic, when he discovers a diamond, known as 'The Heart of the Ocean', as well as a drawn picture of a woman. An old lady contacts Lovett, claiming that she is the woman in the picture. What follows is a breathtaking story of Rose DeWitt Bukater on board the Titanic. On board she meets a poor boy named Jack Dawson who both fall for each other. Day's later, they both must try to survive when the great ship hits an iceberg and goes down deep into the ocean.If you ever want to see one of the best film-making examples, then 'Titanic' is one of them. Some of the lines might feel a bit cheesy and the love story lines might feel a bit too much love filled, but just watching it was an amazing experience, and i was only watching it on a DVD. The fact that the film is based on something which actually happened, makes it so tragic and so emotional to watch. I'm not normally an emotional guy, but i just felt devastated seeing everyone happening on it. The music doesn't help prevent the emotional experience, as it's some of the best music i've heard on dramatic sequences. The special effects are also amazing too with some amazing realistic shot of the ship.

"James Cameron's ""Titanic""",raimi3,27 November 2005,"I have waited several years to attempt to review this film for several reasons. I wanted to have my thoughts completely in order. I didn't want to join either side of the debate here. One side feels as though this film is the greatest of all time, the other comes with a force of backlash the size of the tidal wave in ""The Abyss."" Well now, nearly a decade later, I write my thoughts. I, like many males my age, am a huge James Cameron fan. I absolutely love Aliens, The Abyss, and the Terminator films. I feel as though he has an amazing eye for how the action in the scene needs to be conveyed on the screen. He has a very unique and complete imagination. And an unbelievable work ethic to boot. Nothing, in regards to these points, changes in Titanic. He is on his game. And he deserved everything he got back. This film is truly one of the greatest risks in all of film. Just take The Postman for example. The Postman was released this same year and went down in history as one of the biggest box office flops of all time and is regarded by a harsh majority as one of the worst movies of all time as well. Yet Kevin Costner worked hard and a lot of money was spent in order to create the film. So why did Cameron's film fare so much better?James Cameron involved more viewers with this source material than his other projects had. He still integrated amazing visuals and top notch effects into his film to please the male 18 to 30 crowd, yet the inclusion of a grand and harrowing love story caught the interest of female and older viewers as well. This is not a sell out. If you listen to James Cameron speak about this film, his interest was completely emotional from the beginning. I can't imagine how he must've felt observing the remains of the great ship laying silently at the bottom of the sea, knowing how many died and how many lives were changed when it sank. I feel as though he achieved his ultimate goal when he made Titanic. The action scenes here were a necessary tool in order to tell his human story to maximum effect, not the human story being necessary in order to tell his action story as is usually the case with his films. I feel as though he did a very good job with this change.As for any clich√©s. Honestly, I don't see any. There of course is the usual story devices used to get characters into conflict, but let's be honest people, this film has no more a Hollywood clich√© as say a movie like...Good Will Hunting. So let's put that backlash theory to rest. Also, I've heard quite a bit of talk about historical inaccuracies in this film. I'm sure that there are quite a few, so I won't even attempt to argue. I will however point out that other historic epics have made great films with this same problem, and haven't seen nearly half the backlash that Titanic did. Take Gladiator, Braveheart, or even a more intimate movie like Cinderella Man. All great, all historical, all inaccurate. So who really cares. Is it a well made movie? That's all that really matters. Titanic is a well made movie.Titanic is by no means perfect. It is not the greatest film of all time in my opinion. But no one can argue that this film will go down in history as a great achievement. A very rare diamond in the rough that achieves box office glory, critic applause, and a large trophy cabinet. For new viewers of this film, watch only on the merits that are presented to you on the screen. Forget what the pro and con people have to say, forget how much it made, how many awards it won, and how historically accurate it is. Just let it in. My guess is that you will enjoy yourself. Afterall, this is nearly required viewing anyway. P.S. After almost ten years, I still feel as though the music in this movie is as good as it can get. James Horner does an amazing job creating a timeless back drop of music that will help carry this film through the ages.9/10",9/10
The Titanic sinking is what a No Deal Brexit will be,jeremycorbyn,3 June 2019,"Well.... the British people made their decision, we must respect that result. I'm so sad and heartbroken. This film represents the fall of Great Britain in the years ahead, Titanic was a British ship and had everything going for it, until it hit an iceberg after being manipulated by people only interested in money and power. The same thing is happening to Britain now and it won't be long until Britain hits that iceberg. I'm sorry I couldn't serve the country I love and every time this film is on I play the violin and weep tears of sorrow because I failed my beautiful country. The acting in the film was top notch, as were the special effects and the dialogue. However the sheer sadness of the film, all those lives lost and also the way it kinda predicts the future deeply saddens me and makes me suicidal every time I see it and for that reason I can't give it more than 8 stars. I would've given it 9 stars before the referendum but now it's 8 stars. May those that died on the Titanic rest in peace.",8/10
"No matter how awful the situation may seem, beauty always has a way of showing itself; if even for a short time.",chrisbrown6453,9 November 2000,"Titanic opens with Brock Lovett (Paxton) and his crew as they begin to dive down 12,500 feet to the wreckage of the R.M.S. Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic Sea on April 15, 1912.  The movie jumps from present day, to the day of that ill-fated voyage, then returns to the present day.  That unfortunate day begins with Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) winning a ticket to ride the Titanic back to America where he is from. While on board, he meets Rose DeWitt Bukater (Winslet), a woman being forced to marry a man she does not love.  While on board, Jack and Rose develop a loving relationship, and spend all their time together hiding their feelings from all those who oppose.  Titanic follows the two as they fall in love, evade the jealous ex-fianc√©, Cal Hockley (Zane), and eventually watch as their very short time begins to come to an end due to the sinking of the great Titanic. 	Of the many characters that went through changes in Titanic, I chose to discuss Rose DeWitt Bukater, and why she represents a three-dimensional character.  When we first are introduced to Rose, we get the impression that she is a little `rich bitch.'  She pulls up on the boarding dock in a caravan of new cars, welding a barrage of luggage.  When she first lays eyes upon Jack, who is on the lower deck with the rest of the `commoners', she has already formed her inferior opinion of him.  It is not until Jack stumbles onto Rose attempting to leap from the aft of the Titanic, and saves her, does she begin to realize that he is not inferior, and instead an interesting man.  Rose soon begins to fall in love with Jack, and this is where we see her change from that `rich bitch' to a caring, lovable woman. We later find out that even though she let go of Jack by the end of the film, she carried the memory of him her entire life through the beautiful necklace she wore as Jack sketched her portrait. 	 Titanic is filled with irony, symbolism, and conflict.  The fact the Jack Dawson won his ticket to ride on Titanic, only to perish on it's very first voyage, is the first taste of irony that we experience.  Also, how heartbreaking is it that just after finding true love, they are split by the death of Jack?  Tragic. 	The greatest use of symbolism in Titanic occurs within the scene where Jack attends the dinner with Rose, Cal, and others.  This represents the life that Rose is bound to, and desperately seeking to escape.  The opposite happens when Jack takes Rose down to the lower deck, and we witness Rose expressing her most comfortable, newfound personality.  We also cannot forget the use of the diamond necklace.  The necklace ultimately represents Roses' undying love for Jack, which she has held onto all her life.  Only after she visits the wreckage of the Titanic is she finally ready to let go, and subsequently releases the necklace to the sea, and passes on in her sleep. 	As with many of James Cameron's films, Titanic uses numerous close up shots to convey intimacy.  A perfect example of this occurs in the scene when Jack is drawing the nude form of Rose.  Another technique that I feel James Cameron has mastered is the use of sound and/or music in his films.  A right sound effect, or musical score as in Titanic, helps to complete that scary slasher scene, or that sad death scene, or even that scene where words just cannot express the right feeling as in that beautiful scene in Titanic when the lifeboat is being lowered with Rose inside. 	The film Titanic is such that in my opinion could be considered as having both a realistic and romantic ending.  The fact that Jack Dawson died at the end makes it a realistic ending; while having Rose walking to the rear of the ship to toss the ever symbolic diamond necklace into the night darkened sea creates the feeling of a romantic ending. 	Titanic proves to not only push the envelope, but break it wide open with the masterful direction by James Cameron.  While Titanic's photography would reason to be realistic, it is by all accounts formalist.   The use of distorted camera angles, wide-angle shots, and camera movements make it such. 	As I earlier stated, the use of a great musical score in any film will make, or break that particular feeling the director wishes to convey.  It is said that realists films employ minimal musical scores, while formalist films come with big scores that are hard to ignore.  Titanic not only has the critically acclaimed `My Heart Will Go On' theme song, but many beautiful scores such as `Rose' and `Southampton' which, in this reviewers opinion, is the main reason this movie was as beautiful as it really was. 	Costuming for Titanic was definitely elaborate and by itself is another reason this film is considered a formalist film. 	Lastly, the way the story and characters unfold is widely considered formalistic.  Formalist films are ones with courageous heroes (Jack) and beautiful women (Rose).  The story in Titanic took place on the biggest and most prestigious ocean liner ever built, which coincides with the fact that formalist films take place in exotic settings.  The only inconsistency that I have encountered with James Cameron's Titanic being measured a formalist film is the fact that it could be said that the film contains two different endings.  The first, by definition, could be considered realist because Jack Dawson ultimately died after the sinking.  Since the older Rose was shown tossing the necklace into the sea, achieving a final internal peace and showing that she is ready to let go and join Jack in the afterlife, it is my opinion this proves that it has a happy ending and hence should be referred to as formalist.",10/10

Almost as if they chose the best characters around the universe, brought them to the Titanic and let the invisible cameras role from there.I'm not a big fan of love/ romantic films (though music wise I do love the Beach boys, Elvis, Aventura..) but this movie is definitely in my top 3. Mostly because of the cast, movie props & the true story behind it. Making a part 2 of this movie??? I don't know. There is but it's a budget type movie. You know, they just don't make them how they used to. Especially like the old school movies now and days try to make it look authentic. It's just not good/ believable. Maybe if they used the same cast with a different twist. Perhaps a rich ''famous'' boxer as the main character. Leonardo as the experienced trainer. Rose's granddaughter same age as the famous boxer... A modern boxer though. A good guy. Not a boxer who's usually the villain if you catch my drift.

Each shot is well done. I like how anything not having to do with roses family or jacks friends actually happened. They had more that you can see in their numerous deleted scenes. All the actors were brilliant. I was surprised when I heard Kate Winslet in her British accent. The music was flawless.

Best love story I've ever seen,todd2u,22 October 2000,This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Everything about it was EXCELLENT. The James Cameron really did a good job on this movie. The music was so beautiful. The plot was so touching and sweat. The character are excellently written. I don't know anything about this movie that I don't like. I recommend this movie to anyone who like a really good romance story. This is the most beautiful movie ever made.,10/10
Sucked,bmurray-2,15 June 1999,"I have never seen a more over-rated film.  The special effects were very good and the non-fiction part of the movie was all solid, but the rest of the story was so contrived.  The lead acting was pitiful and not credible in the least.  I don't understand how anybody would ever want to sit through the full three hours of this movie more than once.",1/10
brief,redcustard,19 June 2003,"If you enjoyed this movie, good for you.  If you thought it was a load of schmaltz and special effects and were bored speechless, try watching ""A Night To Remember"" (1958) - it's actually about the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and not a fanciful fairy tale.  The choice is your's.......................",No Rating
This is the most disgusting movie ever made.,hopping_hessian,2 December 2000,"I HATE this movie. It was badly scripted, badly acted, and very boring. If it was just any other chick flick I would roll my eyes and ignore it, but because Cameron used a historical backdrop, I can't help but notice it. Cameron said he made up his done to death Romeo and Juliet story line so that people would have a ""human conection"" to the ship. There were more than 2000 human conections on the ship that he just ignored. Those were stories of real people whose lives were forever affected by this ship. I think that it's sick to use the deaths of more then 1500 men, women, and children just to make money.",1/10
A misjudged masterpiece,Edd-N-Furter,30 April 2012,"When Titanic was released for the first time back in 1997 it became a cultural phenomenon: for 12 years it was the highest grossing film in history, winner of 11 Academy Awards, turned Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet into huge movie stars and made My heart will go on sung by Celine Dion a romantic anthem.However, with the passing of the years being a fan of Titanic became the equivalent of having bad taste and poor judgment in films. I personally disagree with this highly subjective assessment, since Titanic is the best example of how to make a sweeping epic like those that used to be made in Hollywood's golden age.Thus, James Cameron uses the tragic sinking of the ship that ""not even God could sink"" to tell the already iconic love story between Rose DeWitt Bukater, the American girl betrothed to a steel tycoon whom does not love and Jack Dawson, the aspiring artist who has traveled the world in search of his identity becomes a desperate struggle to survive once the ship hits an iceberg and is destined to sink. This aspect of the movie has always been criticized, as Cameron chooses to tell a fictional story instead of focusing on one of the many true stories of the passengers; this is a risky decision that pays off due to Cameron's ability to associate reality and fiction respecting the historical perspective, the chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet and the unexpected sensitivity with which Cameron tells a love story (something unusual for him, given his previous experience in science fiction movies), it could even be said that without Jack and Rose the film wouldn't have had the same impact and success.This does not diminish at all the impressive historical recreation not only of the Titanic (for which an almost exact replica of the original boat had to build), but the period in general, and this is not limited to costumes and scenery, but also in the notes on the differences between social classes existing in the early twentieth century and decadence disguised as opulence, which unfortunately have not changed much today.The sinking of the Titanic has been told numerous times in film and on TV, but James Cameron's version has become the obligatory reference, not only for the reasons already mentioned, but also for the incredible realism and technical accuracy this is portrayed achieving really shocking moments and scenes of high emotional impact that are not quite successful on other versions and that make us partakers of such tragedy as if we were watching it live. This is due to the use Cameron makes of digital technology without being overwhelmed by it, since he understands that digital effects must serve the story and not vice versa.Special mention to the brief but poignant appearance of Gloria Stuart as old Rose, who serves as the narrator of the story, and gives consistency to the story as well gives it humanity and warmth.Titanic has not only withstood the test of time but also the unflattering trials of those who call themselves connoisseurs of good cinema and remains one of the greatest epic films ever made.",10/10
"Wow, I found this film highly unenjoyable",Slademan,29 November 1998,"I held off on viewing Titanic until it was let out on tape. I had heard horror stories from friends and colleagues. They spoke of oceans of tearfilled faces and groups of 12 year old girls singing along with that god-awful Celine Dion song. So I dodged the theaters until a friend bought the tape. Out of morbid curiosity to see this ""epic"" film, I borrowed the tape, and sat down to watch it with her. My lord, it was the LONGEST freakin' piece of schlock I have ever seen. As my friend began to sob after the death of Leonardo, I got about as emotional as I do when I watch those AT&T long-distance commercials. You know, the ones where a little boy in L.A. talks to his daddy who is on a business trip in New York. And the boy always tells his father, ""I love you, daddy."", then the music cues to pictures of the teary-eyed father. Well, I saw a parallel between the commerical and movie Titanic. Both are contrived, blatantly staged, and chocked full of cardboard characters. The film was a filthy attempt to contort and force the emotions of the lowest common denominator. An striking example of this film's attempt to grab people and literally wrench the tears out of them come with the scene where the frozen, dead mother cradles her frozen child in her arms. Had this scene been in any fillm where the emotions were not completely artificial, I would have cried. But the fact is that this film was devoid of any real, heart-felt emotion. So when I saw this scene, I felt nauseous and grew full of spite. I now loathe Cameron for his utterly plastic,  inhumane protrayal of the Titanic disaster. Yet it appears he tapped a class of people bountiful enough to garner Titanic in excess of 600 million dollars in the states alone. I never knew America was so replete with people of such bad taste, people who would not only like, but view repeatedly this sad excuse for cinema. I weeped after seeing Titanic, but not do to its shoddy screenplay or horrifically unrealistic acting and emotions. I weeped for America, and the death of American filmmaking. I weeped knowing that such a film could garner accolades and billions of dollars, and that this bounty would push studios to make bigger films with smaller characters, crappy scripts and pretty faces devoid of ability that would pack seats no matter the quality of the film. (Here comes the TITANIC melodrama.) I could see a future where Coppola, Kubrick, and Malick stood on the gallows, pleading to the masses, now anesthetised and made prostrate by Springer and the numerous Titanic sequels. The directors voiced there thoughts on the death of intellect in America, then the masses let them hang as they chanted ""Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!""Cue ""My Heart Will Go On"" and the sobbing girls.",1/10
The Greatest Movie of All Time,jOeLrOgErS90,14 March 2014,"It gets me every time, I'm an emotion wreck at the end. Titanic is the only few films I have watched that is just as enjoyable as the first watch.A 3 hour film normally requires dedication and sustain concentration with many films offend drag on but Titanic could be on for 6 hours and still be just as engaging.Kate and DiCaprio are just so perfect for this role and are very believable in there performances. There's not one second that you think that there are acting in a film which says it all. Many people would say watching Titanic is a guilty pleasure but not for me its just a pleasure.",10/10
Icebergs anyone,flingebunt,4 March 2005,"The Irish plans to tow an iceberg to Belfast to commemorate the making of the Titanic seems a good enough reason to write a review of this movie.So here is the spoiler of this review. They build this big ship, they think it is unsinkable, it hits an icebergs and sinks. (Other breaking news, the earth is round, Christopher Columbus fails to get to India but discovers America).The true genius of this film is that it understands that movies take us to another place that we could not normally go but where we have a desire, either openly or secretly, to venture.We have all heard of the Titanic and how it sank. But do we really know what it would be like to be there, in the ""ruddy"" north Atlantic as the largest and safest ship sinks beneath you? James Cameron uses two methods to make this come alive. Firstly, and the most obvious are the sets and special effects. A full size tilt-able Titanic and CGI. Even though the CGI looks look computer graphics it is good enough to mean we don't really need to worry about it (I am sure in a few years they will run the computer models through better software and knock out a better print so Titanic fans can buy the Titanic experience all over again).The other technique is to create 2 fictitious characters that we care about who he put anywhere he wants during the sinking process so that we can really feel what is happening and meet many real people and see their stories.The movie is 3 hours long, but once the Titanic starts sinking you become involved in that part of the story as if it is a story starting afresh and your attention doesn't waver from that moment on.Overblown, pretentious film making that won the Oscar because that is what American films want to be. However it remains highly entertaining.",8/10
A Bit Long But A Great Epic Love Story Worth Seeing,mOVIemAN56,29 May 2005,"Titanic is the fictional love tale of a rich girl and a poor boy falling in love on the 'unsinkable' ship destined for New York City, from Europe. Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a poor boy living in Europe, well just sort of hanging out in Europe in 1912. Outside the bar he hangs in, the largest ship ever built, the Titanic, is being set to sail. After winning an unbelievable card hand, he wins a ticket aboard and to America.While Jack camps out on the 3rd Level, Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) is spending some rough time on the 1st Level. While Jack spends his night on the deck, Rosw rushes past him, ready to jump off the boat and to her death. Jack convinces her not to jump and the two begin to spend some time together and slowly fall in love. But as the days slowly tick away an unknown obstruction stands in front of ship, just a few miles ahead. One obstruction that would set the ship into history.The film beautifully shot and wonderfully acting. The love story is better then most. Instead of two kids just meeting and having sex that night, Cameron took time to let both Jack and Rose develop and progress into the relationship. The dialog between the two flows easily and the love connection is strong and well-portrayed. The special effects are a bit overwhelming especially when the ship is sinking. My only fault with the film is its length. I don't have a problem when a film extends 3+ hours when necessary but this extending 3 was unnecessary. Too many scenes are shown of Billy Zane running around and could have been edited out. Other than that the film is perfect. The story is told with great detail and flows less like a history lesson and more like a love story. The film is quite gripping and overwhelming at some parts but is well-worth seeing.Titanic. Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, and Gloria Stuart.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",9/10
so sad!,ippadi,14 January 2006,"I like this film and have watched it quite a few times and, if i'm watching it properly (i.e not doing homework or talking on the phone at the same time) the end always makes me cry...especially when (old) Rose says about only 6 out of so many thousand people being saved *sniff*it also has some comedy which makes it even better because i don't think films that are purely romantic are that good as they always end up being really mushy :)apparently they wanted to cast Matthew McConaughey, from How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days, as jack which i think would've ruined the film, but that might just be because you can't imagine the film without Leo!i give the film 8/10 because some bits are a bit strange but it's great to have a film that you can watch over and over again and still like!!",10/10
Two ways to look at it,jdreedatmit,21 April 2003,"Titanic (1997) appears to be one of those movies that you can either love or hate.  Personally, I'm in the latter crowd.  But I have my reasons.There's no doubt that James Cameron spared no expense with sets, models and the like.  Unfortunately, it was ruined by the two ""stars"" (Winslet and DiCaprio) and their Forbidden Romance.  First of all, it's just plain not realistic.  My family worked on White Star Liners (and later Cunard) for years, on both sides of 1912, and the romance just plain wouldn't have happened.  Nor would it have been allowed to continue.  And they certainly wouldn't have allowed DiCaprio to get on the ship.Whether you like the romance, the emotion, the love, whatever, this is basically another example of Hollywood exploiting a tragedy to make a glitzy, sugary, appeals-to-the-masses movie out of it.   This could have been an excellent remake of A Night To Remember (1958) (not that it needed remaking) what with all the great sets and special effects, but instead the failed.  It's just like what they did with Pearl Harbor (2001), which was poor version of Tora Tora Tora (1970).  I think Hollywood has learned their lesson by now.  But if you want cheesy, not terribly believeable romance set against the backdrop of some of our century's worst tragedies, go see Titanic (1997) and Pearl Harbor (2001).  If you want to see well-executed movies about these tragic events, see Night To Remember, A (1958) and Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970)",1/10

A True Masterpiece!,zeekvoarik,3 March 2021,"I first saw this movie in theatres. When it came out, I was skeptical. I am not a overly-enthusiastic about the majority of historical movies but, I decided to give this one a try. I remember it like yesterday. Walking into that theatre and smelling the scent of popcorn. There was a short line in front of the room where I was to watch the film because people were trying their best to get in on time. I picked a seat up front (even though I prefer to sit a bit farther back), and I got ready to view the film. The lights dimmed and the entire room fell silent. I remember that at the beginning of the film, I was slightly bored. The opening few scenes were different than most movies I had watched back then. But, as the film went on, I grew more and more excited to see what would happen next and I actually became invested deeply into the story. The intense ending with the ship sinking was scary - yet epic! And, when the movie came to a close I was thrilled. I had enjoyed it more than I ever thought I possibly would. I decided to buy it on VHS a few months later, and I played it for my (then teenage) kids. They loved it as well.There was not a single scene in this movie where I thought: maybe this isn't a great film or maybe this was a waste of time. Every single moment was another awesome moment and Leonardo and Kate's interaction with each other on screen felt genuine and real. I love this film now, and I expect I'll continue to love it as time goes on. It's become a classic and a definite must-watch for movie-goers of all ages!",9/10

Can this be any more overrated?,Mike-299,11 April 1999,"There are movies that you don't care for the first time you see them, but when you think back it grows on you. So you see it again, and realize that it is, in fact, a great film. Then there is this overrated piece of drek. Now, I will admit it was beautifully filmed. But it was so overblown, so drawn out, that the more I think of it the more I hated it. It was unrealistic to the point of just being impossible for me to enjoy. The characters- with the exception of Jack, Molly Brown, and Thomas Andrews- were impossible for me to like, and therefore, care about. I know that Rose was supposed to be the heroine, but she was just a spoiled little rich girl. It's a shame this tripe won an Oscar for best picture.",1/10
A Mathematical Certainty,ferguson-6,7 April 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. Of course I saw this one a couple of times when it was first released in 1997. Having only watched it once since, I was happy to hear it would get a re-release on its 15th anniversary ... even if the marketing hook was the post-production 3D. My thought was with James Cameron working his technical magic, the 3D would be fine, and maybe even add to the spectacle of the sinking ship. After all, he was the mastermind behind Avatar, which with Hugo, are the only two films (in my opinion) that haven't been weakened with 3D technology.Unfortunately, I can't overstate my disappointment in the 3D for Titanic. The colors and lighting are destroyed. When we first see young Rose (Kate Winslet) arrive to board the majestic ocean liner, her lavender hat appears almost gray through the 3D glasses. And later, the crimson Renault, where Rose and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) get to ""know"" each other, appears dull and darkened. Additionally so many face shots are darkened, rather than illuminated by the beautiful fixtures that adorn Titanic. I was so saddened to see such dullness on top of such greatness. Sure, there were a couple of times where the 3D gave a boost to a special effect, but the film is so beautifully made and such a technical marvel, that the impact is minimal to the positive.What I will say is that despite my frustration with the technology, I do hope a new generation is introduced to the film. Personally, I am no fan of the love story between Jack and Rose. However, it is such a delight to see the young, eager versions of Little Leo and Kate as they go about their antics. They were 22 and 21 respectively during filming, and we now know them as mature actors and major movie stars. That wasn't the case when Titanic first premiered.The real genius of this film is two fold: the story-telling and the technical achievement. Gloria Stuart stars as 101 yr old Rose and she is used to perfection in telling the personal story of Titanic. Her love story with Jack allows director Cameron to show off the amazing ship from all angles ... first class, third class, dining rooms and engine rooms. She also allows the viewer to connect with the characters on a personal level. The technical aspect is even more astounding. Sets, models, CGI, and documentary footage are all blended to form a cohesive presentation of one of the most dramatic events of the past 100 years.Here are a few notes of interest regarding the movie and those involved. The movie was number one at the box office for 15 consecutive weeks and grossed more than $1.8 billion ... a record that stood until Cameron's Avatar eclipsed it. Cameron was already an established sci-fi director with Terminator I & II and Aliens, but he almost had the plug pulled by the production company due to cost overruns. Matthew McConaughey was the producer's first choice for Jack, but Cameron held firm for DiCaprio. The elderly couple hugging each other in bed as the ship sinks were based on the Strauss' who owned the Macy's department store chain. And yes, there were Astor's and Guggenheim's onboard when it went down. If you have seen the movie before, pay particular attention to the secondary characters ... the wardrobes and acting are tremendous: Francis Fisher as Rose's mother, Karthy Bates as the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown, Billy Zane as the fianc√©, David Warner as his henchman, Bernard Hill as the Captain, Victor Garber as the architect, and Jonathan Hyde as the sleazy ship owner. Also catch Suzy Amis in one of her last acting jobs before becoming Mrs. James Cameron ... she plays the granddaughter to ""old"" Rose.This is an historic film version of an historic event and should be seen by all movie lovers. Some of it is a bit hokey, but if you doubt the technical achievement, compare it to A Night to Remember, the 1958 version of the Titanic story.",8/10
AMAZING!!!,gmatuszak,15 May 2021,"I absolutely adore this movie, the plot, the actors, the romance, drama, tension, AMAZING. If you have a free night and have nothing to do, literally watch this, it's great. The plot is just WOW, theres some comedic scenes to cheer the mood up and james cameron does a great job of that, no wonder this film had received 11 oscars? You could watch this 20 times and never get sick of it, it's great, kate winslet, leonardo dicaprio, kathy bates, all of them and even more people i could list do a great job in creating this atmosphere. The movie is rich, it looks and feels rich, the language, old times, the plot is amazing, finding out that rose is still alive but basically 100 years old is a great add on to the movie, 3 hours for this movie almost seems too little, i'd love to see even more of the relationships between the characters, honestly for a 1997 film too, the quality and the effects are just AMAZING. This will change your aspect on how you view life and movies, it's life changing and it is a masterpiece. 11/10! It's glamorous!",10/10
The film presents a distortion of the facts.,rjs-5,1 January 1999,The movie portrays First Officer William Murdoch in a way that is totally contrary to the truth but instead suits a particular propagandist position. This is both immoral and grossly hurtful to Murdoch's descendants. No wonder the Chinese government recommended the movie to their people. It amazes me how modern American filmakers seem to delight in tearing down the society and values they have grown up in. The film is an insult to all those passengers and crew who showed such tremendous courage in the face of a horrific death. In reality it was NOT two 90's style teenagers who were the heroes of the Titanic.,1/10
All-around excellent accounting of the doomed ship,Wuchakk,27 November 2014,"The hype surrounding James Cameron's ""Titanic"" when it was released during Christmas, 1997, and early 1998 was so great that it worked against the film in a way. Few films could live up to such ballyhoo. Nevertheless, viewing it apart from the mass hoopla, it shines in all-around greatness.The movie of course details the doomed maiden voyage of the magnificent Titanic from April 10-15, 1912. This is one of the greatest tragedies in human history. There were only enough lifeboats for half of the over 2200 men, women and children aboard. Why? Because the Titanic was so great they thought she was unsinkable. When it was all over only a little over 700 people survived and 1500 people went to their grave in the cold North Atlantic.This is a movie and not a documentary and, as such, includes a fictional drama to hook the viewer. This is where people will either embrace the film or criticize it. As far as I'm concerned, the story of Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) is excellent. Rose is only 17 years old and is being forced by her fearful mother (Frances Fisher) to marry the pompously rich Cal (Billy Zane). Jack, by contrast, is a dirt poor wandering artist who's free as the wind and brims with life, love, and humble honesty.Rose instinctively feels trapped and would rather die than marry some fake snob, no matter how handsome and wealthy. She's attracted to Jack because he's the antithesis of Cal. By contrast, her mother views Jack as a threat because she thinks that her only hope of retaining the airs of wealth is through marrying her daughter into a rich family. The ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) is another significant personality. She's new enough to ""high society"" to still relate to the ""commoners"" and so goes out of her way to help Jack and his brushes with the stuffy aristocracy. Thrown into the mix is Cal's priceless diamond necklace for Rose and what happens to it.Speaking of which, there's a modern story (1996 anyway) that brackets the main plot. Bill Paxton stars as a treasure hunter obsessed with the necklace, Suzy Amis as Rose's granddaughter and Gloria Stuart as old-aged Rose. Gloria was 85-86 years old during filming and she just shines in the role.The casting and acting is exceptional, particularly the main performers. It's no wonder that DiCaprio and Winslet went on to great success. In addition, the depictions of the vessel and her tragic sinking are magnificent.Yet it's the powerful subtext that inspires most. What good is great wealth without love, virtue, respect and freedom? In her untainted teenage idealism, Rose would rather die than have this. Jack lacks the former but possesses the latter and, therefore, possesses the former as well, even if you can't see it (if you know what I mean). Rose instinctively senses this and therefore throws all caution to the wind. Some criticize that she goes too far by prematurely getting intimate in the vehicle, but ‚Äì remember ‚Äì she grew-up with her life-stifling, greedy, fear-mongering mother and so when she finally gets away from her clutches she naturally goes overboard. Have some compassion! As for the fate of the necklace (***SPOILER***), Rose didn't cash-in on the diamond because she didn't want to rely on Cal for money; and she didn't give it to her granddaughter or the treasure-hunter because it wasn't hers to give. Since the insurance company paid out on the policy Cal's dad took out on it, the diamond belonged to the insurance company if found; it was no longer the property of Hockley or his heirs, and it wasn't the property of Rose either, because it was not made over to her by a deed of gift or a bequest. She came into possession of it by mistake and so was obligated by law to turn it over to the rightful owners or, if that was not possible, to legal authorities. More importantly, the necklace was a reminder of her promise to Jack to ""Never let go."" She thus throws it into the ocean because she had fulfilled her promise to live life to the fullest and was now ready let go, particularly since she finally returned to Jack's watery grave (***END SPOILER***).It wouldn't be right to fail to acknowledge the great score by James Horner and the theme song sung by Celine Dion. Great movies are great because their producers take the time & effort to achieve excellence on every level.Needless to say, because the film runs 3 hours and 14 minutes you have to be in the mood for a long movie to fully appreciate ""Titanic.""GRADE: A",9/10
A grotesque embarrassment of ill-ordered riches.,HenryHextonEsq,11 June 2003,"An appalling, galling 'spectacle' and slapdash mix of effects, melodrama and romance. ""Titanic"" is utterly misguided; shamefully populist and hoist by its own focus group petard. This is not showmanship of the grandiose and warm kind of a Selznick; it is the cold, mechanical assemblage feat of a bragging Cameron. It is far from unique; and much in the usual Hollywood action vein, with undramatic noisiness, prosaic lighting, and faceless acting.Even 'Our Kate' can't save it... the busty Miss Winslet puts a bit more presence into things initially, but she can't truly work within the confines of such a dire nonentity of a script; her Rose just becomes irritating and strained in effect as the film wears painfully on. Di Caprio is awful; a rubbery, glib little presence who increases the quotient of dull artifice - that this film is already unduly well stocked with. Indeed, this film may as well not have included any actors, as Cameron seems so entirely disinterested in them; for all the pretence of this being a 'human story', there is precious little humanity in this film. An out-of-place love story 'suffices'; actors like Bernard Hill are left adrift, with little to convey - even in a film stretching past three hours. A problem is that the effects are flashy and thoroughly incongruous to any image of the historical event. Crucially there is no dignity to this film; where it should have used Gavin Bryars' poignant, cavernous, driftwood-epic soundscape, ""The Sinking of the Titanic"" for its score, instead we have James Horner's parodic, cliched John Williams-esque bluster and blandness, telegraphing every 'emotion' and example of pyrotechnics. It's an awful score, instilling a very familiar, action movie-moronic ethos; this sense of the events being sold short comes across equally in Di Caprio's pipsqueak playing and Winslet's rather ungainly starry turn.How much better would the historical events have been served by Bryars' music, dignified, still and unusual camera placements, and a depersonalized sad grandeur? A semi-documentary, in grainy, mournful black and white would far better suit this subject; think ""Wisconsin Death Trip"" and you'll be understand in part how I envisage it. I want to shut this awful James Cameron white elephant out of my mind, and let a more graceful film play there.Rating:- */*****",3/10

"Good movie, but hard to believe it made as much as it did.",Aaron1375,19 February 2003,"First off, this was a rather good flick for me.  Nothing to great...I have seen a lot of films since I have seen this one that I like a heck of a lot more, but this was pretty good.  A love story set on the Titanic is basically the story with a few plot points about class.  Seeing the ship sink of course is the highlight for me cause it really did look good.  I saw the actors did alright...I won't badger Leo, I don't hold anything against a guy just because lots of gals like him, I just call him a lucky bast#rd and be done with it.  Kate looks pretty good in this flick and does a rather good job as well.  Like I said though the boat sinking is the highlight and one complaint I have is that there wasn't enough character developement of other characters besides Leo's and Kate's...I have posted some theories on why I think it grossed so much on the message board here, because frankly I think it was a fluke it did gross so much, but I am not saying it was a bad flick.",8/10
Bloated wreck,Oscar85,17 December 2001,"I don't know quite how to describe this film. When it was in release everyone was calling it an instant classic, but now it seems everyone hates it. People, make up one opinion and stick with it. But I say this film is and always was terrible. The most horrid was of 194 minutes in my entire life. The story of the Titanic, first off, is not very interesting to watch for three odd hours. And the artificial love story does not help down this horse pill of a movie. The music is the only thing that I enjoyed, but even that wore out its welcome near the last hour of the film. Cameron should've sunk this film before it came out and robbed people of 1.8 billion hard-earned dollars. I'm sorry to myself for seeing this film because everyone else was, and I'm sorry to everyone else who saw this embracement for this reason.

"Why I like this film, as a longtime student of the actual Titanic",manalone923,29 January 2004,"A fellow reviewer wrote earlier that Titanic is among his or her favorite films, and sometimes people laugh. I myself laugh, not at the movie but at that statement. I echo what the reviewer said, which is that at the time, almost everyone loved the movie or at least recognized good stuff about it. It was critically acclaimed, made more money than any movie in history, and received uncountable awards including the most Oscars ever, tied with Ben Hur at 11 wins.Now, I shake my head when I see that Titanic currently has a rating of about 6.7.  Jeez people, view a movie for how it is rather than how oversaturated it got!!!And that's the problem. Titanic WAS a very good movie- and since I was interested in the actual ship a decade before the movie was made, hopefully I can tell you why I support it. The technical achievements alone were grand, the scale of the movie was epic and moving, and to James Cameron's credit, it was almost 100% accurate to the many different details of the Titanic legend. Of course, to accept this one has to ignore the fact that the main characters are fictitious amalgams of real Titanic passengers.Those two characters are Jack Dawson and Rose Buttaker, played of course by the leads Dicaprio and Winslet. Their awkward meeting and subsequent falling in love is played against the oncoming disaster, which, as everyone should know, happened 4 days into the ship's first voyage. At 11:40pm on April 14, 1912, the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank 2 and a half hours later.Now for the movie itself. The acting, although passionate, is goofy at times due to a script that was much maligned as being stereotypical and bland. I don't hate it that much, it doesn't sound too far off from what people are like when they're stupid in love. However, my problem arises here: Rose seems to be witty and independent, yet she becomes a doe-eyed child when she falls for Jack, who seems to know the answer to everything and even needs to heroically command Rose to ""get back"" when the iceberg comes by. More and more their relationship turns from possible to downright one-dimensional, as Jack becomes a grand hero and Rose becomes a helpless damsel. Granted, each character has scenes where they betray that limit (Rose in fact saves Jack's life at one point), but that's an exception to the rule. Another problem is that, quite simply, a relationship between a first class woman and third class male is possible, although entirely improbable. People just weren't that open minded in 1912, although for this movie it doesn't seem too severely hard to swallow.That having been said, I don't have much of a problem with the rest of the movie. This is because it stays admirably close to the facts, and pays insane amounts of detail to each scene. Director Cameron was in fact often joked about due to his fierce, almost anal commitment to the details. The ship looks real, because most of it is. The band played until the very end, which they really did. The ship indeed broke in half at the 2nd funnel, and if you look close, the iceberg scrape actually dots and dents the ship's hull instead of tearing a solid gash, as it actually did in real life. Although the 1958 Titanic film ""A Night to Remember"" had no fictitous characters and sticks religiously close to what really happened, James Cameron's Titanic is technically the most accurate, especially due to the breaking of the ship which wasn't proven until after the former film was made. A couple technical slips do get by, such as a terrible blue screen effect seen when the drunken baker is standing atop the risen stern (just before the final sinking). There's a shot of victims rolling down the upright stern section near the end, and we can see one of them bounce off of the cylindrical capstans, obviously a soft prop. But hey, these are just gaffes in an otherwise very good technical achievement.In closing, I still like this movie, as I did when it first came out (though not nearly as much now, after a dozen viewings). It has a lot of emotional impact, it stays very, very close to the actual facts, and it can even be argued that although fictional, Jack and Rose are just an example of what really happened to many of the couples on the real ship when it went down. I don't think a better movie about the Titanic can be made, although the aforementioned ""Night to Remember"" is also extremely good and in many ways just like James Cameron's film. If you see Titanic, the film, for what it tried to achieve, you can see that it is in fact a well made and successful film. I know it's hard to get past the negativity that its oversaturation caused, but at its heart I think it is an excellent movie.",10/10
"Trite, inaccurate fluff",s-price476,6 February 2009,"A disgrace of a movie that glosses and glamourises an awful disaster.

The fact that deck Officer Murdoch shot people is not only false and a slur on the name (wasn't he a hero in all this mess?) was superfluous to the plot anyway.

"In Spanish class, I wrote a story portraying the famous movies of 1997 aboard the Titanic while it was sinking.",lee_eisenberg,19 October 2005,"Okay, everyone knows what happens in ""Titanic"", so I'll discuss a few other points. While the movie was in the theaters, one of my friends went to see it 13 times, just so that he could find goofs; the one that he picked up on was when someone opens a door, turns his head, and you see that it's the wrong color. When I took a sailing class in summer, 2005, the teacher explained why specifically the Titanic sank: it was traveling way too fast for something that size (so they couldn't turn in time), and the metal on the ship's sides was rather shoddy; that is to say, they endangered everyone's lives so as to save money for themselves (well, that's one of many times when those at the top have put profits ahead of safety). And I have a question: considering how many people died on the Titanic, was it appropriate to use this event to further Leonardo DiCaprio's career? As for that story that I wrote, it portrayed Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck (from ""In & Out"") believing themselves to resemble Leo and Kate; Al Pacino (from ""Donnie Brasco) realizing that he was going to sleep with the fishes; Jim Carrey (from ""Liar Liar"") admitting: ""I can't lie: I wasn't watching for icebergs while I was steering!""; Kim Basinger (from ""LA Confidential"") wondering whether or not she would look like Veronica Lake at the bottom of the ocean; and Jack Nicholson (from ""As Good as It Gets"") still inside his cabin and saying ""Don't knock on my door! Even if the ship is sinking, don't knock on my door!"".Oh, I forgot to say my opinion of the movie. When everyone at school asked me what I thought, I always said ""Well, I..."" That's what I'm going to say here. I consider ""Titanic"" right down the middle. I think that ""In & Out"" was the best movie of 1997. End of story.",5/10

Over-hyped commercialism,pawebster,29 January 2006,"This is a bad film. When I say ""bad"", I mean it in a whole range of senses. Just a few of them: The fictitious love story is anachronistic, exploitative and implausible (he gets a monkey suit and gatecrashes the First Class?). The way a modern-movie-style sex scene is fitted into the film just stinks.Even the special effects -- so highly praised -- are suspect in my book. The ship gliding through the water does not look real. It is somehow ""flat"".The scene where Jack dies in the water is nearly as laughable as the unforgettable death scene in ""Love Story"".Even calling the ship ""Titanic"" instead of ""The Titanic"" is wrong.It just goes to show what hype, hype and yet more hype can achieve.",4/10

Best James Cameron movie on the face of the earth,princessstrickland21,5 January 2019,"It starts off with Old Rose telling a story of the Titanic....and it only got better from there.Leo is amazing portraying Jack, the poor man who went on Titanic, because of a lucky card game.
Kate Winslet, also amazing as Rose the rich woman who no longer wants to be rich or marry a man because she and her mother are out of money
Billy Zane, AMAZING as the supposed fiance to Rose and will do anything to make her happy, even if it means framing Jack.So many characters on one ship towards fate. It is one movie that I would see over, and over, and over again.I even have read many actors like Matthew McConaughey was going to portray Jack or Nicole Kidman becoming Rose. But the actors they had portraying Jack and Rose were amazing.They even added real life people that were on the Titanic as well whom either survived or drown. Like Molly, the rich woman who was known for surviving the titanic sinking.

"""Iceberg Straight Ahead!""",jerekra,19 February 2009,Titanic is one of the most successful films in recent history. It won a lot of Oscars and really is one of the better films that is based off a historical event.The effects are phenomenal in this film. The Titanic looks as how it should have and looks real. They really got the details down perfectly and it seemed as if each room shown in the film was flawless.Some of the scenes in this film are just awesome. Especially the scene where the Titanic hits the Iceberg. THe whole sinking scene in particular is dramatic and will keep you captivated.Acting is good for the most part. DiCaprio is pretty good in this film and this may be one of his better performances but I really have not seen that many of his films. Same with Kate Winslett. Actually acting may be the biggest weakness of the film but that is just because everything else is outstanding. I thought the captain of the Titanic was well performed as were the entire crew of the Titanic.Music is spectacular. Not much more to add.This is a really good film. Not a ten out of ten for me but a solid nine out of ten and a film that I highly recommend to the likely two people out there that have never seen it.,9/10
Waste of time (A lot of time),Timbo-34,14 June 2000,"I don't see what all the hype is about this movie.  I think it's rather pointless that they spent so much time and effort to ""re-create"" the ship itself, make it as real as possible, and then create some stupid *fictional* love story to go along with it.I mean... the boat sank.  It takes 3 and a half hours to tell that story? Come on, get serious.  I've got better things to do.  Like rinse out my eyes with paint thinner.Ever wonder why Titanic made so much money?  Four words... Thirteen Year Old Girls.  That's all.  Who else is shallow enough to see this movie more than once?  My little sister, in fact, saw it eight times... EIGHT!  That's almost 26 hours wasted, watching that pansy DiCaprio whine about love.Do you realize that at $10.00 a ticket, 183,530,000 tickets were sold. Each ticket wasting 3.25 hours of the viewers lives, 596,472,500 hours have been wasted on this show, and that if each person lived an average of 70 years, 69,811 years, or 997 lives have been wasted watching the Titanic. James Cameron has effectively murdered 997 people.  I say we lynch him.",1/10
An Incredible Cinematic Masterpiece,john-hitchcock,7 September 2010,"Ever since I saw Avatar, I began to develop a strong respect for James Cameron, so when I found out he was the genius behind the cinematic legend that is ""Titanic"", I got excited.The film is really well written. I love the way it is told in flashback.It begins with a group of present-day treasure hunters exploring the wreckage of the Titanic (which results in some brilliant underwater footage). They find an old safe that's completely empty save for a drawing of a woman. An elderly woman suddenly phones them and says she's the woman in the picture. She then tells the divers and her granddaughter the main plot of the film.One thing that I really like as well about the flashback format is the editing. Each time the film always shifts between the past or present via a match cut, such as a video of the wreckage of the Titanic in the present day changing into the Titanic before it left in 1912 or a close-up shot of √Ωoung Rose's eye to the eye of the elderly Rose in the present.The characters are all really well developed. I love how the film manages to blend some of the real historical figures (I.E. the crew of the Titanic) with fictional characters (I.E. Rose, Jack) and yet it is still incredibly believable, as if this really was a true story. The story is largely focused on the relationship between Rose and Jack, but the film constantly manages to develop other characters. Even the present-day characters are really well developed.The story is very well written, and I love the way how it changes in tone throughout. The film starts off exciting, with many people excited, yet still manages to portray Rose in a somewhat sympathetic role. A large portion of it is the romance between Jack and Rose, but the film manages to have some dramatic scenes, with a large sub-plot of the story being the conflict between Rose and the rest of her upper-class family. The film even manages to include a bit of humour here and there, but doesn't take it too far. However everything changes near the end, when we have the iceberg, and all of a sudden the film becomes very dark and tragic.The climax is very impressive. It takes place once the Titanic hits the iceberg. At this point, the film manages to successfully shift focus between different people. It manages to focus on the protagonists, but also manages to focus on the chaos and tension as the ship sinks and the crew struggle to keep order and get the passengers off safely. It brilliantly manages to capture the tragedy and horror of the disaster.Overall this movie is a cinematic masterpiece and one that you definitely should see if you haven't already.",10/10
Lots of Hype but little substance,bbhlthph,14 August 2003,"In general I am not keen on large budget spectacular productions such as ""Titanic"". Whilst the large budget goes in creating expensive but not always useful (and even sometimes counterproductive) special effects, it also creates a situation where enormous public interest becomes necessary if the investors are to recover their money; so that  the film concerned has to be continually promoted with a great deal of hype. Seldom does the excessive expenditure lead to a better script, better acting, better direction or better photography, and these are what govern the quality of the final product. Titanic won an incredible number of Oscars, which are supposed to be completely independent awards (11 in all I believe). At the time I cynically took the view that the need for these Oscars as a bait for attracting large audiences had led to extensive funding of media promotions designed to ensure that this particular film was in the mind of all the judges when the selections were actually being made. I also remember feeling very upset that several superb performances in lesser low budget films made during the same year appeared to be being squeezed out by all this hoop-la. Nevertheless once all these awards had been made, I had sufficient faith in the Academy Award system to assume that there must indeed be something totally exceptional about this movie, and I made a mental note that I should see it at some future time. It was a long time after this, when I did so, and found to my amazement the film was only a somewhat indifferent fictional drama in the tearjerker category, with its appeal stiffened by some very spectacular special effects. It was also far far too lengthy to sustain the viewer's interest in its rather simple dramatic story. My faith in the Academy Award system was bruised but not totally broken as I told myself that I must be missing something if I could not fully endorse the apparent judgement of the vast mass of the public and almost all the critics. This feeling continued until only a few days ago when I chanced to browse through the user comments on this film in your data base and at last realized that my views were quite widely supported and I need not be ashamed of them. (The fact that I initially felt ashamed of my rather critical views is probably a good indication of the degree of hype which developed around this film.)
I am not attempting to deny that Titanic is certainly a better than average film and I do not want my comments to appear totally destructive. The recreation of the ship, and of its death throes, is superbly done but if one is viewing the most expensive movie ever filmed one is entitled to expect very dramatic special effects - the real question is what do they really contribute to the story, and in this case the answer is very little. Overall, the film is extremely well made, but its script is very poor, the characterisation is stereotyped and much of the acting is no more than acceptable, I can see nothing other than some effective but unimportant special effects to justify the status it has been accorded. It fails right from the start as it does not appear to know whether it is intended as a documentary record of a dreadful tragedy or a bittersweet but highly improbable romance. The disparate pull of these two themes continues throughout the film, but ultimately leaves the documentary recreation of the liner and its one tragic voyage as certainly its best feature.Why did the scriptwriter and director (James Cameron) feel that it was necessary to incorporate a fictional romance into this film? Over fifteen hundred real people actually died, wives and children were torn from fathers they hardly knew. There was real drama in why the Carpathia did not steam to the rescue of the survivors more promptly and this has remained of ongoing interest ever since. The design of the ship, the materials used in its construction, the route followed by the voyage, and the part played by the so-called blue riband for the fastest Atlantic crossing have all been featured in dramas relating to this voyage and some of them were also mentioned in passing in this film. Surely there was enough dramatic interest in the actual story to avoid any need for the fictional additions. In practice this decision has detracted so much from the tale which was crying out to be told that for me at least the film was spoiled.The rating you give it will depend primarily upon whether you regard the fictional romance or the factual documentary of the Titanic's only voyage as of greater importance. My rating for the romance between Rose and Jack would be no higher than 3/10 because most of the characters concerned are no more than caricatures. The documentary leaves out so much that a similar rating could seem quite generous, but the special effects recreation of the actual sinking makes me feel that a rating of 5/10 would actually be reasonable. Averaging these, and ignoring the problems associated with not knowing whether the film is a romance or a documentary, yields a final rating for the film as released of 4/10, which is probably reasonable.",4/10

"Titanic"" is a cinematic masterpiece",GasparXavier,29 January 2023,"This movie tells the tragic love story of Jack and Rose set against the backdrop of the fateful voyage of the RMS Titanic.

It is a film that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.",9/10
A sinker,paul2001sw-1,18 August 2003,"Superficially, the loss of the Titanic is a strange theme for a movie, since we all know what happened before it even starts.  But ""Apollo 13"", despite its faults, showed that a story of this sort (albeit one with a happier ending) can still succeed through a low-key focus on the human condition in a state of adversity.  For ""Titanic"", however, writer-director James Cameron has chosen to embellish the facts with a predictable and cliched romance, in which Kate Winslet's feisty, intelligent (and way too modern) heroine overcomes the stupidities and rigidities of her privileged background to learn about herself and life through the love of Leonardo diCaprio.  Boy-man diCaprio appears hopelessly miscast, playing a ""man of the world"" in the fashion of the lead in a high school rom-com.  In fact, his role is a pretty straight reprise of his Romeo in Baz Luhrmann's brilliant Shakespeare adaptation - but whereas the whole of that film was imaginatively conceived so that this character worked in that role, in Titanic he is desperately unconvincing in a piece of social commentary that prefers corn to meat at every opportunity.Yet oddly the film is compelling to watch, at least until the iceberg hits, precisely because you know what must come in the end.  But when the boat starts to sink, so does the film.  When the natural drama of the situation begins to climax, Cameron focuses instead on the ludicrous personal melodrama of his leads, and an extended action sequence that makes ""Star Wars"" seem believable by comparison.  The final sinking, by contrast, is actually quite moving, though needless to say, presented with a minimum of economy.Overall, ""Titanic"" is a contradictory film.  Its massive budget shows in the beautiful attention to visual detail (particularly in the mighty portrayal of the engine room), and the bombastic force with which the director combines the private and the public sides of an unquestionably massive movie.  But it also shows in the good-versus-evil plotting, the way that every scene is milked for more than it's worth, the need to tie everything up with a semi-satisfying moral knot, and the general violation of the principle of Occam's razor (i.e. ""it is vain to do with many what can be done with fewer"").  Both an awesome spectacle and a perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood, ""Titanic"" is a true film of its era.  But watch ""Das Boot"" instead for a real maratime epic.",5/10
Deserves a higher rating,filmsbythefire,15 April 2010,"I have to say, when it comes to romantic flicks, people seem to go to extremes (and I admit, I've done it too, giving Titanic a ten). It seems you either love it with a vengeance and woe betide anyone who doesn't agree, or you hate it so passionately you would happily murder the poor actors and actresses simply for appearing in it.This is ridiculous. While I do enjoy the film, I have no problems with people who didn't, and if they dislike the romance then that's their opinion, which they're entitled to. Seriously, why turn it into something? Personally speaking, this is still one of my favourite films, and I saw it years after it came out (as always) so the success had ebbed away. But unlike so many, I didn't go with expectations. All those people who went for a documentary on the disaster, or endless shots of old Leo... I saw it without expecting anything. I didn't give a monkeys about DiCaprio, I knew next to nothing about the actual disaster, and I was simply hoping it deserved its record-breaking 11 Academy Awards. And I thought it did, frankly.The acting was top-notch, the music was wonderful, the visuals were stunning. While the romance was indeed stereotypical and contrived (and I gave this a ten), it was still pulled off excellently, and I really did feel for the character, which is a mark of a good film. I don't think that the ending spoilt the film, which many people think it did. I am not saying that they are wrong, or that I am right, because that's not true. It's about opinions. I just thought it was a nice touch - a sort of backhanded happy ending to round off an otherwise rather depressing Now-they'll-never-see-each-other-again scenario. I thought the film had many, many memorable moments, and the disaster itself was not downplayed - it fitted smoothly around the romance, which incidentally helped to give a sense of perspective to the whole thing. Many couples really will have been torn apart that night, albeit probably not from different classes. The sheer drama unfolding on-screen cannot really be questioned. It can be disliked, of course. But it is good acting nevertheless.",10/10
Must watch if you're looking for a great movie!,RavenStarViudez,23 October 2019,"A great epic romance and disaster film indeed, Titanic the movie. Titanic is a 1997 American film directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, the film is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson)and Kate Winslet (Rose Dewitt Bukater) as members of different social classes who fell in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.This movie is not just showing how two persons fall in love but it also shows social issues like the inequality that has been the focused from the very beginning and at the end of the movie. First from how money generated that ship like those who paid lower stays at the bottom part of the ship and those who paid more stays at the top part of the ship. Why does it matter? Because they have thought that the place at the top is more comfortable and safe like if ever the ship will sink, they will not be the first ones to sink. At the last part, it shows how the rich ones were saved by the countable boats they have used and the poor ones not treated well then died in the sea.This movie is truly a good one because it is not only about love but also about some facts and true-to-life happenings like how people are treated based on their social status. That is considered as Marxism. But like other movies, this one also has bad sides like the noticeable mistakes in the cinematography and it has scenes that are not appropriate for kids.Overall, the movie was good for people who wants to watch a movie that is double purpose and for those who love watching dramas which makesal them cry. But as far as I have observed, this movie is really well known and can be known by most of the people living when 1997 came and until present. And I suggest this movie for those who love handsome guys like Leonardo DiCaprio <3",10/10
My review,ilkim_ertas,18 October 2019,"Titanic is an award winning romantic film. The film was directed by James Cameron and came out in 1997. It is set in a ship called Titanic. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are playing the leading roles.
Main character Jack Dawson won a ticket for Titanic at gambling. And he met with Rose DeWitt Bukater who she came from a rich family in Titanic. Jack fell in love with Rose. But the ship hit an iceberg and Titanic began to sink.
This movie has a wonderful story. I have watched it more than one. But each time i never lost my excitement. It will always be my favourite movie.",10/10

Succeeds as Eye Candy but not much else,MF210,8 November 2003,"My Rating:* out of ****.Titanic is such a sensational looking film that it could be called the most expensive piece of eye candy. Like all films by James Cameron, Titanic is visually stunning from the sets to the special effects. Yet while Cameron's films are great to look at they usually have more going for them than this one. Titanic was unworthy of many of its oscars and is one of the most overrated films of all time.The first problem with this film is its script. James Cameron is not a professional at writing love stories and this clearly illustrates that point. The dialogue is corny and stupid. It makes me wonder why he didnt have Aliens invade Titanic. Yes the idea sounds horrible but I will take ""Get Away From Her You Bitch"" over ""Your gonna live on and your gonna have lots of babies"" I mean how corny and dumb is that.Strong Acting is a requirement for a film to succeed over a flat scrip. However, this is where Titanic fails again. I had no clue what Dicaprio was trying to do with this character. I am glad Spielberg taught him how to act in Catch Me If You Can. Kate Winslett is also horrible but her character is treated badly by the script. However, Billy Zane is actually quite good. Kathy Bates also holds her own, though her screentime is limited. Gloria Stewart is horribly irritating as the older Kate Winslett character.James Cameron is a filmmaker who has great skills. Yet those skills are not on display here. His direction comes across as inept and uninspired. His skills here are better than his skills as a screenwriter for the film but thats not saying much.Like I said, Titanic succeeds as eye candy but not much else. The Sets are glorious looking. The cinematography is beautiful. The Costumes are breathtaking to behold. The Sound is top notch. The Visual Effects rank as some of the most impressive to come out of the 90s. Titanic is nice looking in pretty much everyway. If only everything else came into play Titanic would have been a good film. The visuals of the film were something not wasted in the making of this film.Titanic suffers from two other flaws: Unconvincing Chemistry and an OVERLONG running time. The chemistry between Leo and Kate was hailed as some of the best of the 90's but I found it flatter than a pancake. Titanic is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy tooo long. It has a very uninteresting and sluggish two hours. The only excitement I got was seeing Kate Winslett's boobs, which are more impressive than the film. During its final hour, the pace does pick up. The Sinking is a glorious sight yet Leo and Kate's characters are still there. The last shot of the film is stupid, that has deleted scene written all over it.James Cameron has a solid resume of films. He created Terminator I and II, Aliens, and True Lies. All these films showed the work of a skilled director, even though The Terminator gets the lowest rating it was a good film and showed a director with skill. Titanic shows a cocky asshole who should give his oscar to Curtis Hanson(director of the superior LA Confidential). This is easily the worst I have seen from Cameron.",4/10
"As a romance, it is simple, as a disaster movie, it is underwhelming",Ziya90,18 March 2010,"Let's start with James Cameron. He made the greatest action movie ever made and also one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time, The Terminator 2 Judgment Day. The Terminator was excellent too, but 2 surpassed even that. By only these two movies, he has become one of the greatest directors of all time, don't you agree? However, it was really weird that he wanted to make such a movie. Thus, Titanic does not look like a James Cameron movie at all and additionally it is lack of creativity, James Cameron creativity. You know, by considering The Terminator movies, you can see how a creative director James Cameron is. Titanic is an ordinary movie, a simple movie on all counts. Everything is simple that I will mention later. At that time, Leonardo Di Caprio was at the top, the beloved of teenage girls, in fact, young or not, females were admirers of him. I like Di Caprio and he is still liked, may be even more because of the performances he gave in his recent movies, but what I am trying to say is that I try to find out the reasons, why a lot of people love the movie and it broke a record at the box office, became the most watched film of all time? It was owing to Di Caprio? Well, I don't think so, I mean not only owing to him which is sad. Because as said the movie is simple on all counts. As for Kate Winslett, as an actress, she is one of my favorite actresses ever, I just love her, but players cannot save a movie, this is what I believe. The love story is simple. Let me summarize it one more time. A poor boy. A rich girl. And the rich (and black hearted) fianc√©e of that girl. The family of the girl want their daughter marry him, but she is not sure. Then, the poor boy and the girl meet and fall in love with each other. See? You know, James Cameron is rather an action (and science fiction) director, isn't he? and this is a disaster movie besides romance, isn't it? but this side of the matter, action, excitement are simple either. You expect the same masterful, perfectionist and creative level for Titanic, but it is not. I did not get satisfy on this count, because Cameron does not focus on disaster, he focuses on romance and this is weird. This is a three hours movie, but the disaster side of it is unsatisfying. Therefore, the people who had expected an exciting, suspenseful disaster movie disappoint like me. As for the Oscar issue, yes it broke a record in the Oscar history too, 11 Oscars! To me, there are two wrong decisions in the Oscar history. One is Titanic's 11 Oscar winning, the other is Shakespeare in Love won the best picture Oscar instead of Saving Private Ryan. I should confess that the other was much more painful, because if you ask me, to give the best picture Oscar to Shakespeare in Love while one of the other nominees is Saving Private Ryan is something like to give the best picture Oscar to The Notebook while one of the other nominees is 12 Angry Men. Returning to Titanic, the love story in it is not heavy or dull at all like Shakespeare in Love by the way which is good news and despite I am not female, it was real touching and at the end, my ears filled with tears. However, unfortunately these do not make the movie great. Let's talk about the branches which Titanic won Oscar. By the way, as for entertainment, yes I was entertained, but not very much. The best editing. Well, this is not Memento or Amores Perros, the editing was 'normal' in this one. The best cinematography. If it is one of the bests, then what is Amelie then for example or Across the Universe? The best costume design. What were the costumes, daily life costumes? Yes. Titanic was not a period movie exactly wasn't it? Even if it was, the costumes were ordinary, daily life costumes. The best art direction. Again, Titanic is 'normal' on this count. Amelie, 2001, Batman, these are the examples come to my mind now. If we talk about the themes of the movie, it is seen that they are simple either as everything else. Follow your heart, money does not bring happiness, believe immortal love etc.",5/10

A Joke,svswinger-2,24 November 1999,"I can't begin to express how bored I was with this movie. It's not that it was a poorly made movie. I understand the movies appeal to the romantics at heart, but that still does not validate it as the best movie of all time. It was boring, far too long, and completely uninteresting. I've always thought the movie could have stood on it's own as a much more fascinating film if the first half had never been made. Cameron did a tremendous job of showing the horror and hopelessness the members of the ship felt while the ship was sinking. But it took so long to finally arrive at this point in the movie, it was almost impossible to get back into it by that time.  This movie was thoroughly uninteresting, and the only redeeming factor that comforts me is that there will never be a sequel. 1/10",1/10
Timelessly and universally appealing,hk-84771,9 February 2020,"A spellbinding, moving and awe inspiring motion picture.Even to be able to successfully make such a big scale movie is a feat in iteself. Particularly, the second half, showing the ship sinking is a great filmmaking achievement.Besides, the film offers an audio-visual treat by virtue of its great settings, beautiful costumes and wonderful background score.But even with all these features, the movie would have been superficial if the story wasn't poignant enough. Thankfully, the love story is one of its strongest aspects. I think there are two reasons why the love story is so touching and iconic:1.)The idea of watching the romance between two charming young lovers on the grandest, most magnificent ship in the world is fascinating.2.)On top of that, knowing that it's not too long before the ship hits the iceberg and starts to sink,thus separating the two of them forever.The ending is particularly remarkable. There are a few scenes towards the end which add great emotional depth to the ill-fated love story:The 101-year old rose dropping the diamond in the ocean, the camera moving through pictures of young rose while the old rose is asleep and finally that magical last scene- capturing the essence and spirit of the whole movie- in which the ship becomes alive and the two lovers reunite.In a nutshell, Titanic is a great motion picture which is timelessly and universally appealing.",10/10

Excellent movie!! One of my favorites.,NYYfanlife90,7 January 2007,"I loved Titanic a lot. I wasn't around when the Titanic actually sank. But this movie made me glad i wasn't around to see it. The artwork and the storyline really keeps you wanting more and more from this film. The acting was pretty good and the love couple of Jack and Rose definitely didn't make this movie boring because i wanted to see what would have happened in the end when the ship would have sank. Some very minors things with the movie was that the acting was a bit corny in a couple of areas, and the fact that they didn't go a bit more into detail with the characters but doesn't make it bad in anyway what so ever. Another impressive is that after 10 years people are still talking about how great this movie is, and for some reason you haven't seen it yet, GO WATCH IT NOW!!!",9/10
"Technically brilliant, otherwise merely OK",rbsjrx,28 December 2002,"My best comment for this was that offered by my then 13 year old granddaughter. When one of her friends gushed over it, her only reply was, ""Let me guess... There's either a rich boy and poor girl, or a rich girl and poor boy. The ship sinks. One of them dies. Right?"" There are so many great real stories to be told of the Titanic, why do almost all film makers feel compelled to invent a contrived, maudlin story line?Of course, unlike her friend, my granddaughter already knew the stories of the Strausses, Wallace Hartley, John Astor, Benjamin Guggenheim, Molly Brown, and so many others.If James Cameron had simply chosen to use all his skill and special effects budget to tell the sort of honest story told in ""A Night To Remember"", it would've been an all-time great. As it was, it alternated between brilliant and annoying.",6/10
"""Good Romantic Drama!""",gwnightscream,12 August 2012,"Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Suzy Amis, Victor Garber, Jonathan Hyde, David Warner and Bill Paxton star in James Cameron's 1997 drama. This begins with oceanographer, Brock Lovett (Paxton) and his crew searching deep into the abyss for the legendary doomed ship, Titanic. After he finds a portrait of a young woman, an elderly woman, Rose DeWitt Bukaker (Stuart) contacts him and comes aboard his boat with her young granddaughter, Lizzy (Amis). Rose is asked to remember her experiences on Titanic 84 years prior and she begins talking about the ship, her romance with young artist, Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) and their last hours on Titanic. Winslet plays, Young Rose, Fisher plays her mother, Ruth, Zane plays Rose's demanding fianc√©e, Cal Hockley, Bates plays Ruth's friend, Molly Brown, Garber plays Thomas Andrews, the designer of Titanic, Hyde plays Bruce Ismay, the namer of Titanic, Warner plays Cal's security aide, Spicer Lovejoy and Eric Braeden (Victor Newman on The Young & The Restless) makes an appearance as Molly's friend, John Jacob Astor.

Millionaire romantic movie.,insomniac_rod,7 December 2008,"I watched this movie on theaters 11 years ago, around December or January 1st. 1998, I can't remember. All I can remember is that everybody watched it twice or even more times on the theaters while it was enough for me to watch it once.The plot is directed only for girls or guys who HAVE to go with their girlfriends in order to get laid or something.The situations are romantic oriented and nothing more. The soundtrack is catchy but that's it and the f/x are really spectacular but nothing you haven't seen.Still, this is a perfect romantic movie that will have your girlfriend crying and hugging you.Everybody hates it because it's filled with clich√©s but on it's time it was extremely popular that everyone had to watch it to comment about it.Nowadays, it's just looks like a Hallmark production.",6/10
Titanic should have been called something else,flashman-6,30 April 1999,"It is always the way in Hollywood these days, Why let history get in the way of a blockbuster movie. Titanic has plenty of good points about it, but any student of the disaster could not help but be disappointed. Especially with the glaring inaccuracies and cliches this movie had to offer.The American's brash and almost looking like they knew the damn ship would sink.The British, stiff and emotionless in first class who would given the chance be quite happy to shoot the Irish peasants on the lower decks if the were allowed.The British lower classes were a bunch of thugs.The Poor Irish as a load of Guinness swigging biddly biddly dancing bumpkins, clearly the victims in the disaster.The point I am try to make is that the tragedy of 1912 was a multilayered affair, with moments of great sadness and bravery throught the two plus hours of the ships sinking. I feel that James Cameron had sacrificed this for the love story of Rose and Jack which is a shame.I did enjoy Titanic but I thought it was a missed opportunity to show what happened. For my money a far more moving film about the sinking of the Titanic was ""A Night To Remember"" with Kenneth More and Honor Blackman amongst others.The Titanic story is a deeply emotion subject I would truly recommend A Night To Remember if you want to watch a film about the sinking of the Titanic and watch Titanic if you want to watch a Love Story.",3/10

How they could create such a marvel is beyond me. The story is the key, however. It really is a relatively simple boy meets girl, falls in love, saves her life, gives his sort of a tale. A Romeo and Juliet on water.The performers are engaging, but I wouldn't go so far as to say the acting was spectacular. DiCaprio was very good, but otherwise the acting was adequate. The story was extremely good and fit in well to the historical event.I only wouldn't give this movie a 10 because it was a little depressing in the end and it was also a period piece - not my favorite genre.

The second best film ever!,MehdiTaba,30 November 2014,"First of all, I need to say that James Cameron is a genius, he did this masterpiece really precisely, he did tons of researches for getting the best result, even the floor coatings' colour/shape/texture.James Cameron in an Interview said: ""still there are some errors in some parts"" but I need to say come on... it's perfect, a little wrong detail can not harm anything!If I want to talk about Titanic there are hundred of things that I can mention but here are some of them.Titanic is my favourite and number two film ever because it's perfect in all the aspects of film making, for example, visual effects are perfect, score and soundtrack are one of the best in cinema's history, cinematography is perfect, casting and acting is great, plot is great, emotional impact throughout the film is superb and balanced like no other film, directing is best, production is extremely great, entertaining level is more than any wants, costume and production design is really precise and beautiful...Love story in Titanic pictured perfectly, things such as, emotions, love, looks, heart beats, remission, sacrifices, pleasures...There is a great thing about this, you just want to follow the whole things in the film 'til the end, all the scenes are professional and even disaster and the tragedy is projected well and have messages. Discrimination between British/Irish passengers and social class collide is something really important in this screenplay. You can find a lot of different symbolism and particular points about upper-class way of life and its meaningless and the way of living your life as a free human being, minimalistic, sincere, beautiful, living, joyful and wonderful. This message was throughout the film even in the last minutes when Rose dropped the Heart of the Ocean into the sea, as a symbolic act of letting go of meaningless materialistic stuff and reliving that moment and joining with Jack in her mind with that act.There are just two things that I'm not completely alright with it. Firstly, its length (not so much just about 20 minutes more than it's needed) secondly, originality (it could be a bit more original and fresh).I extremely recommend it to wise and emotional people and lovers of cinema! I know some people who hate Titanic and all of them are extremists and irrational people!I watched Titanic more than any film out there! 'cause I can totally feel it.A big ThAnX to James Cameron for doing this and you for reading this.9.5/10.",10/10
tiresome,himbletony,23 November 2014,"This movie is tiresome in the extreme, totally over-hyped, over-rewarded and ridiculous. I first saw it when it first came out and the interminable amount of time it took before the iceberg hove into view was mind-numbing. So many problems. The opening framing device was totally unnecessary and felt sooooo long, while adding nothing to our understanding, nor even piqueing our interest (wasn't that supposed to be the intention?).Then the cast of stereotypes! Awful, and all saddled with flat, uninspired dialogue or worse still, retrospective smart-alec bits (""Picasso? He won't amount to much"", ""Freud? Who is he? Is he one of the passengers?"" .....groan). The fatal casting of Leonardo di Caprio, still in his baby face mode as a well travelled man of the arts (???), while Kate Winslett, mature and a little blowsy (nothing wrong with that) appears almost old enough to be his mother, is a serious misjudgement. Her fianc√© (a luckless Billy Zane) lacked only a moustache that he could fiendishly twist in his most unctuous moments. A total pantomime creation (the villain in Avatar was a similar one dimensional character). I saw the beginning on TV recently and watched again up until Kate is rescued from leaping off the stern. I hoped that I might be able to reassess it. No chance. It got me just as annoyed as the first time, the improbabilities just as ludicrous (would the crew REALLY have allowed Leo and chum to the bow to yell ""King of the world""?). The only reason this got two stars was for the technical sequences during the sinking, but as for the fate of the protagonists, by that stage I was past caring. If only they had employed a talented screen writer. Such a waste.",2/10
WOW!,JoeyJ-2,24 October 1998,"I went to see the film not knowing what to expect. I'm not a fan of romantic films but everyone had been recommending the film so I went and I have to say it is amazing. An emotional mix of watching while knowing. As Jack and Rose get increasingly closer you know the fate that awaits and it starts you thinking of ways they could have avoided it. It's one of those films that remains close to your heart forever.Excellent acting from the whole cast, especially DiCaprio and Winslet. Some scenes which come to mind include the dining room scene, Rose communicates to Jack on a level that the other actors don't even sense, a sentence which is echoed on page 95 of ""James Camerons Titanic"" It is a film that will have you hooked and on the edge of your seats.

Bilge.,swisstoni63,30 March 2002,I decided recently to give this one a viewing (against my better judgment). I thought that reducing one of the greatest maritime tragedies in history to an ill-conceived love story was in poor taste. Previous reviews have said it all really. For a more realistic and emotionally involving film about the Titanic see 'A Night to Remember'. Why do film-makers feel the need to 'spice up' events of such magnitude with improbable plots?? Appalling stuff. 1/10.,1/10
The greatest film ever? I doubt that.,LeonardZelig,5 September 1999,"""Titanic"" has made a lot of friends since it first appeared in theaters, and I can't say that it doesn't deserve them.  Certainly, parts of the film are superb, moving, and really unparalleled among other films.  Then, there are those other parts that aren't.  What really bothers me about ""Titanic"" is that the weakest elements of the film seem to be those that have garnered the most praise among fans.  Allow me to elaborate.For instance, there are the main characters, provided by Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet.  Besides setting off considerable sparks and possessing a great amount of natural chemistry, they accomplish very little.  Actually, that's not completely true for Winslet, who may very well set the record for showing the most cleavage ever in a PG-13 film.  But as far as characters, they are cardboard cut-outs who, while they look very good on screen, are doing little more than taking up space.Of course, this isn't completely their fault.  Both of these young actors can indeed act, believe me, I've witnessed it for both of them.  The fact is, they didn't have much to work with, and here I am, of course, referring to James Cameron's script.  Now, just to set the record straight, Cameron is a very talented fellow.  He knows how to make a completely convincing fake ship sink, how to stage action scenes, and how to tell a story.  Quite simply, he's a good director.  No, no, he's a great director.  But he's a horrible writer.  His dialogue positively reeks of clich√©s and vainly-attempted humor.  And, perhaps that explains why James Horner's fantastic score has so much of the limelight.  Perhaps Cameron realized that his pathetic script wasn't enough to build drama and suspense, so he relied on the music to do that.Now, on another level, the film is a technical masterpiece.  The special effects, cinematography, editing, production design, and all of the other ""back-stage"" elements are simply superb.  While ""Titanic"" unarguably cost an enormous amount of money, it's easy to see why.  The money is right up on the screen, in all its glory, for all to see.  Yet, is it fair to say that a film is great when only half of it truly is?  I don't think so.  On that note, I base my overall rating, knowing that it would have been far better if only Cameron swallowed his pride, put his ego on the shelf for a moment, and hired someone else to write the screenplay.  Unfortunately, he didn't, so we have to suffer for it.*** out of ****.",No Rating
Masterpiece,dollybear-07164,30 May 2021,"Romance isn't really my thing tbh, so it wasn't as enjoyable for me, but I love both of Jack and Rose's characters, and how they were fit for each other. The ending was sad, not just for the couple, but for all the people who were separated from each other or died during the tragedy of the Titanic. This film portrayed it well. I hated Rose's mom and fianc√© so much. I'm glad she didn't return to them and pursued her dreams and experience the life she wanted to live in the end. My favorite part was the process of the sinking of the Titanic, it was really interesting and educational, but also suspenseful and sad. Tbh, the Titanic should've had many test runs by the captain and crew before setting off, so it could avoid such tragedies. Then there could be a happy ending for everyone, Rose could still run away, but then the movie would lose purpose, so yea. I love all the actors and acting, especially Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. This movie was really good, and will be forever, no matter how many times you watch it.

The music is bad, the plot is absurd, the much vaunted realism in recreating the boat was done just as well forty years ago (in A Night to Remember); this is just further proof that the ability of audiences to see movies has deteriorated due perhaps to a combination of food additives and computer graphics.

You're So Stupid Rose,KnowOne1988,16 December 2009,"Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie didn't have a solid ten, overall in the IMDb user rankings. Maybe, it's just cool to not give Titanic credit nowadays, but when it was first made it was really something. When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters. When it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot, like the frozen baby, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. Many people died on that ship, and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that James Cameron stepped up to. And let's not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination it was lovely. They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. ""I'll never let go, Jack."" Titanic is a great film down to it's very core. It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music, and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers.

Every time it is still so sad, because of all the people who died there. Amazingly directed by James Cameron, who must be the greatest director out there next to Peter Jackson.Now it is 10th anniversary since it has been released in 1998 in February. But it still looks like it has been made like yesterday to me, because of the amazing directing and the picture. I don't think anyone could make a great performance than Leonardo and Kate. They were the best couple ever.The real story didn't include Rose and Jack, but it was great idea to make a great story before the sinking, and it was the sadest love story also. When Rose just found the greatest love of her life, she loosed him when the ship was sinking. Think about the great time they could have if both of them survived Titanic. And it was weird when the old Rose didn't tell anyone about Jack after 80 years. I wonder who she went to when the survivors came to land in New York. We know she didn't went to her fianc√©, Cal. Did she really went to her weird mum? Did she go back to her dad? thats a mystery.i would love anyway to go to a Titanic museum. I find the sinking story very touching and sad.

An epic masterpiece!,jake-law123,7 January 2011,"This is considered one of the best made films of all time. James Cameron outdoes himself big time, but this won't be the last epic he ever makes. The story of the Titanic like you've never seen it before. Epicness beyond anything reachable.The story is told in a flashback perspective, with Rose Dawson, a survivor of the Titanic, telling it to a group of scientists, and her granddaughter, telling about her experience on the Titanic, leading up to the fateful night where it would meet its historical doom. It also circles around her life changing star cross love affair with Jack Dawson, (Leonardo DiCaprio) another person on the Titanic.Begins with one of the greatest music scores of all time by James Horner, and then slowly takes us back to the very beginning. Goes incredibly smooth with the camera movement, making each and every individual scene epic as ever. The performances are beautiful as ever, with Billy Zane, Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart, and Leo DiCaprio leading a brilliant cast.The first half is getting everything acquainted on the ship, and introducing all the characters, and setting the plot. The second half consists entirely of the boat sinking, which is very graphic. The visual effects are mind-blowing, with excellent and detailed parts of the ship. The music, editing, and setting really capture every single feeling and thought raced through the actual minds of the real people.One of three movies in history to win 11 Oscars. The others being Ben- Hur, and Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. I had to watch the movie five more times until I finally managed to without crying. Its a real tear fest. Almost everybody in this film is crying. Its depressing as ever, but in a good way. It brilliantly captures the terror of the people. Its hard for a film to do that. James Cameron wasn't screwing around when he made this. Everything in this movie is excellent. Nothing is in fault, absolutely nothing. Everything is 100% accurate!This film killed at the box office, which it well should have. Its a film that will go down in history. A film that nobody will ever forget, and will always cherish every little moment this film brings.",9/10
typical love story but with a sinking boat,martinyoungb,13 May 2019,"So this is basically a typical story where a old woman who reminiscence about her past and tells the story on it. So the love story actually goes like this, poor class man wins ticket for the titanic in a game of poker (I think its a game of poker) and rushes to get on the boat that is about to leave. So when he is on the a couple of nights goes by and he sees a higher class woman trying to attempt to commit suicide by standing threating to jump of the ship into the deadly ice water. So after he intervenes and stops her from doing this they then get to know each other and fall in love.But as this is just another higher class meets lower class love story the thing that got me was just the amount of innocent deaths that was caused some guy not spotting a bloody gigantic ice berg in front of him which then leads to ship sinking and drowning thousands of innocent people.I personally loved this movie it is a real tear jerker, You will be joining in with rose and telling jack not to let go at end of the movie. It does tug on your heart but I do have to say this if your wanting a romantic disaster movie to complete your night then this is the film for you.",8/10
Grand Production of an Amazing Tale,gcd70,27 August 2008,"James Cameron has come of age in delivering this grand production of an amazing tale, one of the most fascinating true stories around. ""Titanic"" is every bit as good as everyone has been saying. You can see the three hundred million dollars up on the screen. Authenticity is second to none, as new footage is seamlessly faded in from old. Spectacular and awesome to say the least.All the facts and events are so fascinating you hardly need the human story provided. I certainly could have watched this as a documentary. James Cameron has left nothing to chance. I am hard pressed to imagine ""Titanic"" done better.The cast are all spot on and thoroughly enjoyable! Leonardo Di Caprio is the ideal devil-may-care Yankee who wins a ticket to sail to New York. Kate Winslett is perfect as the well-to-do little rich girl who hates her existence and Billy Zane is at his impressive best as the possessive fianc√© who is heir to millions. The superlative support cast includes Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, Johnathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Gloria Stuart and Suzy Amis.Grand, often haunting music is from Cameron regular James Horner. Editing is smart, and the film passes quickly though it is over three hours. The technical team have performed brilliantly, with computer graphics a particular treat. Set decoration (including a near to scale replica and incredibly intricate interiors) and Art Design are both amazing, recreating the most gallant ship of all with unerring grandeur and style. Cinematography sweeps through it all with panache.After viewing this, you'll feel you were there! Don't miss your chance to see this at the movies. I will certainly be boarding again!Saturday, February 28, 1998 - Village Sunshine Gold ClassIn an era basically void of epics, James Cameron has managed to produce a film that measures up with the likes of ""Ben Hur"". Grand, stylish, sweeping and larger than life is the best way to describe this astounding cinematic experience. I freely admit that I was one of the many cynics who, having heard of the film's monstrous budget, thought that ""Titanic"" would be the biggest flop of all time. I, like many, felt this 300 million dollar production would sink faster than the great ship herself.That was not the case, as history will now show, as ""Titanic"" has gone on to smash box office records, collecting a record equalling eleven Academy Awards along the way. The film's visuals alone justify this, with the ship of dreams brought fantastically back to life thanks to some awesome set design, huge scale replicas and access to the original blueprints. Mind blowing special effects, coupled with superior sound editing, make ""Titanic"" a must at the movies (preferably one with Digital Sound and a huge screen).Cameron brings it all together brilliantly, backed up as he is by a thoroughly enjoyable cast, including Leonardo Di Caprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton and Kathy Bates as the unsinkable Molly Brown. Final master stroke comes from maestro James Horner, whose haunting, beautiful score is the spirit of ""Titanic"", which of course inspired the love theme (a song Jim Cameron never wanted originally) ""My Heart Will Go On"".Saturday, May 30, 1998 - Knox District CentreJim Cameron's grand film of the fateful ""Titanic"" and her maiden voyage loses a great deal of its impact if viewed on anything other than a huge screen. It is still a fascinating tale of how the ship of dreams went to the bottom of the Atlantic for all the wrong reasons.Forget about DiCaprio (miscast) and Winslet (charming), they are mere scenery in a fascinating true story. All those mistakes! Not enough life boats, which weren't filled anyway. Only one boat returning for survivors. Going full speed with virtually zero visibility, no binoculars on the lookout. People locked behind gates below deck, and a seaman who tried to round a giant iceberg in an enormous ship that ""doesn't turn worth a dime"". If the Titanic had've struck head on, it would have stayed afloat.Special effects, sets and costumes are all awesome, but you do really need that huge screen. James Horner's score is top stuff too.Saturday, January 2, 1999 - Video",7/10
you call this rubbish an excuse for a film?!,smokyjoe123,4 May 2005,"Even if i tried for a million years, i could not make this film worse. But stick a robot and a giant llama in and hey, you've got a decent film. It's good when the main character dies at the end, but the other one doesn't because she gets to experience the same kind of trauma i went through by sticking with watching it. The plot is absolutely awful, the scriptwriters evidently have no imagination, and at 3 hours, i would literally rather watch my cat sleeping. the actual best part is the theme song at the credits, no only joking, that's as bad as the film is. anyway, if you have 3 hours to kill, do something else, this is absolute tripe.",1/10
Epic melodrama with superior set design and special effects,timothywalton-31924,11 February 2023,"Titanic is a marvellous, expansive film with the first rate special effects you expect from James Cameron, lending the feeling of vastness and realism you would feel. Lead acting performances are uniformly well done, though the dialogue they have to work with is disappointing. The film is hampered by an unimaginative screenplay, with trite dialogue and poor situations. But the film starts of well enough. The first one half or two hours are enthralling and even breezy, doing well to hide the films poor writing, and are a joy to watch. After this however, the tender love story which has played out is replaced with frantic, frenzy action for the next hour or so. This is the section after the ship strikes the iceberg, as the film attempts to, like a typical Hollywood film, milk every single situation and obstacle they can. This, rather than being suspenseful, just felt boring, languid, and contrived. Thankfully, the film reverts to tenderness in the last 20 minutes, with jack and rose on a piece of wood and the famous ending. The problematic bits of the film are hence those where Jack and rose are engaged in action rather than romance. Hence, I think the movie is overlong, and should've been trimmed down at the parts mentioned. Regardless, Titanic of course, is still a titanic film, with a doomed love story, and beautiful special effects, one definitely well worth a watch.",7/10
Certainly The Best Film Forever,nayansh,7 December 2020,"According to me, this film is simply the best. None other film made such an emotional impact on my heart. This film will always be remebered as a 'masterpiece'. I don't have words for my emotions towards this film. Words are less for such an excellent 'masterpiece'. I can just say that this will be my favourite film forever.",10/10
Yes. One of the greatest film of all.,bluecolor-45634,30 July 2020,"If anyone asks you about this film you should just go watch it. Because why not? It has everything. Love, happiness, sadness, suspense - you care about the characters so much. It's fantastic.",9/10
Titanic is a must see for every one,Luigi Di Pilla,27 May 2007,"Thank you very much for all the staff for this unforgettable and very special movie. Director James Cameron delivers an example how a deep and perfect developed story takes your breath away with high emotional elements. It's not the usual love romance film but it has some of its magic moments. At the end I couldn't avoid tears in my eyes and wished really another end. Leonardo Di Caprio will remain for ever in my heart with the sweet soundtrack and I don't understand why he didn't get the Oscar for his outstanding performance. Anyway, Di Caprio counts no doubt as one of the best actors in the present. At least TITANIC won 11 Oscars and I am not surprised because everything is perfect. The scenery on the Titanic was wonderful done and the special effects were great. The DVD will take a great place in my best of DVD collection. My wife and me rate a solid 8/10. A must see for every cinema fan.",8/10
This is CINEMA,yvksqupp,20 March 2023,Probably the best movie of all time! Everything about this movie is enchanting. You fall in love with the characters so intensely that you feel the tragedy as if you were there. A cinematic revolution like we've never seen before. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart deserved to win Oscars. Some of the best visual effects in film history. James Cameron. James Cameron showed how cinema is made. 25 years have passed and the special effects are still breathtaking. The soundtrack by the late James Horner is memorable. It was legendary. 11 Oscars was little for such magnitude and technical mastery. Everyone deserves to live this cinematic experience. Take a journey back in time. Fall in love. To making each day count! And never let go! I'll never let go Jack! I promise!,10/10
Over-rated,Arkaan,5 April 1999,"Titanic is not the greatest movie of all time ( except box office).  It is not the greatest movie of 1997.  The flaws are many: 1) We know the end to Titanic.  That makes the last hour and a half amazingly boring. 2) James Cameron trivialized it by using two fictional characters. 3) Not many of the performances were that great ( I liked Paxton, Bates, and Stewart) 4) Overlong",No Rating
Interesting...,charlesfrappier,11 July 2001,"Some love it, some hate it.  But no one remains indifferent to it.  The fact that Titanic can raise such passionate raves and rants, even three years after release, testifies of the impact it made.  As for me, it's in my top ten, probably forever.  Sure, the story lacks, sure, the dialogue was wooden at times, but that movie stayed with me for weeks after I saw it for the first time.  Few movies have done it for me to that extent.",No Rating
The Most Wonderful Movie Ever to Grace This Planet... Period,j-jessie-weaver,31 October 2012,"James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is just one of those movies I can watch all day and never get sick of. When it comes on television, I watch it immediately. There is simply nothing bad about this film that'll make you want to hate it.Every scene from ""Titanic"" from start to finish is fantastic; the love scenes to the final moments. You'll find yourself getting way into the plot, as well as feeling for the characters.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are brilliant as Jack and Rose. Once they enter the picture, you cannot help but love any moment they spend together, and their ""forbidden"" romance is so emotional and powerful.The ship's final moments will keep you on the edge of your seat as well as shock you. James Cameron does an excellent job of recreating the sinking. It's hard to imagine that a horrible incident like this happened 100 years ago. Cameron marvels at bringing the disaster to life.On the whole, ""Titanic"" is a wonderful movie. Nothing can describe the sheer greatness coming out of it. If you haven't seen it, I strongly suggest you give it a try.MY RATING: 10 out of 10.",10/10
Epic Romance,benblankenship-20805,21 July 2020,"One of my all time favorites , deserves a much higher rating . There is no romantic movie that could rival it . James Cameroon's crafting of Titanic, and Leonardo and Kate's acting will never age . Left an emotional impact for days .",10/10
Mixed emotions after seeing it years later.,DhavalVyas,27 August 2004,"Titanic' was quite the phenomenon when it came out. There is no movie that I can think of, at least in my lifetime, that became the cultural event that it did. There were many concerns within the film community that the film was going to be a disaster. James Cameron had spent a long time finishing the film and it was the most costly film ever made. Many people thought it was bring an end to his career. All these concerns and predictions were shattered when 'Titanic' came out; it became the highest grossing movie ever and it won more Academy awards than any other movie. It skyrocketed the careers of both Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio. I went to the theaters to see it with family and friends. It was an incredible experience and several people around me were crying. There were very few movies I had ever seen before that had mesmerized me as much as this movie did.I watched this movie in its entirety for the first time in years. The reaction is much different now and the film seems much less impressive. First of all, the graphics in 'Titanic' have not aged well. When the ship is sinking, the CGIs look really fake and dated. Also, the model ship they used doesn't look very good either. It looks cheap and like it was made out of plastic! This does not surprise me because most films do not age well; a new generation of film lovers will not find certain films as impressive as the last generation. Putting that aside, the story of 'Titanic' is not that bad. I think most people know what the story is about so I do not need to explain it. The acting is slightly above average, but the screenplay is so clich√©d and corny, I can understand the acting did not need to be that impressive. The last forty minutes of the film consists of the two main characters shouting, ""Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack! Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose!"" They must love each other so much that they can't think of anything else to say.I don't think 'Titanic' is destined to become a classic. Even though it made so much money and won so many awards, I think most people now see the movie as an embarrassment. Now that I am older and wiser, 'Titanic' just seems like a mediocre film. Pretty disappointing considering how much the movie was loved when it first came out.",6/10

"""Love can touch us one time and last for a lifetime""",Rawal_Afzal,10 October 2015,"The greatest film in the history of mankind, the most engaging love story ever made, this film has mesmerised me like no other on the face of earth. After watching once in childhood I watched this on again at the very start of 2011, and have ever since watched it a thousand times. I am such a huge fan of this film that I have even dedicated a poem to it, consisting of 53 verses (a shame I have never shared it online fearing plagiarism, a fear quite justified given the number of fans it has online). I also watched it at a cinema when it was released in 3D, on the 14th of April 2012, either hours or a day short of the tragedy's 100th anniversary!Each time I watch this film I tend to stay quiet a few hours afterwards and usually have that heaviness in my voice; it just affects my like no other film can. Just to avoid looking like an emotional fool, I usually start a conversation with anyone who happens to be sitting next to me so that I don't end up being in tears at the scene when Jack dies.The great thing about the love story was the joy that you so felt for them. So many hurdles stood in their way, there were so many things to fear from, yet they bore every hardship simply looking into each other's eyes. It is one great display of what the power of love is and what love can make us do. They way they rescue each other from one situation to the other, and the way the whole story builds up, and that once in a lifetime tragic ending scene, it is masterly work by James Cameron.Besides that, the whole depiction of the way the ship sinks, the horror in the end, the way the people die by either 'slipping' from it or in the freezing cold, the panic shown at the time it hits the iceberg, all of it is pure brilliance!Lastly, it should not at all be criticized for not being historically accurate, as for that you better watch a documentary film. They had to put up a build-up to the disaster that it was.",10/10
Good Will Hunting and LA Confidential were much better,Umblezi,2 February 2000,"Too bad about the cheesy special effects- at least the storyline and acting were good. I firmly believe this film winning best film is the most unjust occurrence at the academy awards, along with CITIZEN KANE not winning best picture, and Marlon Brando for best actor in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE. The screenplay and the acting are the most important aspects of any film, and since Titanic was deficient in both areas it should not have received the honour of best film. Granted, the special effects are wonderous and should be honoured, but as a whole the film was not a masterpiece, it did not inspire, and they took far too long to die. There were far better films in 1997, due to their superior screenplay and acting talent, but they were snubbed because of this. It really makes one question the credibility of the academy.",2/10

A movie that teaches you what infatuation is.,YashodeepGolhar,5 March 2023,"James Cameron's Titanic is without a doubt the most accurate version of the ship, the people and the events that took place on a cold April night in 1912 on the North Atlantic. The sinking of the Titanic immortalized Jack and Rose in their love. The most beautiful love is often regret. Without long-term love, eternal love disappears. James Cameron tells us in a piece: Believe in love. But at the same time, it also suggests that without eternal love, no matter how beautiful love is, it cannot compete with life. Rose could die for love, but in the end, thanks to Jack's grace and pleading, he chooses to live for love, and the man left behind is miserable. When Rose, who is an old woman, stands by the boat and throws the heart of the sea back into the sea, I think that was its best destination.",10/10
Blech!,mvg,23 March 1999,"This was arguably the most over-hyped movie of all time. Some of the special effects were great, but others looked extremely amateur indeed. The dialogue was full of cliches and the plot was so predictable. Yeah, I know we all knew the ship was going to sink, but even the love story plot was like a Barbara Cartland novel. Kate Winslet looked great, but my only thoughts in the final scenes were that I wished Leonardo DiCaprio's character would hurry up and die, so the torture could end more quickly.Blech!",1/10
Goes without saying,JayJayE4,17 August 2020,"This has to be one of the best crafted movies ever made this came out in 1997 this movie doesn't really age at all, I watched a lot of documentaries about the titanic because I just was fascinated by that event that took place, the love story was cool for the girls but yes 10/10.

The worst movie ever,antbabe,13 November 1998,I can't believe that people actually enjoyed this movie. It is a terrible movie with horrible actors and a horrific script.

One of the greatest movies ever!!!!!,leonsott,12 December 2022,"I was figuring out what movie to watch and realised that I hadn't seen titanic in years. When I put on I was immediately immersed and by the end of it I was in tears. I completely forgot how brilliant this film was. It builds the atmosphere so well and three hours flies by. It's no surprise it won a staggering eleven Oscars!The movie is a masterpiece and I am greatly disappointed that it only has a rating of 7.9. HOW?!This film should one hundred percent be up there with the top ten. It is brilliant, emotional and exciting all at the same time.This film also has qualities that I really enjoy. Most movies nowadays try to fit into and age rating. If they want an R rati g they'll fill it with loads of gore. If they want a PG-13 they'll try to not go to over the top. But this film just shows you exactly what it was like and instead of focusing on getting a certain age rating they just made a beautiful film and then got given what age it should be for.As I said one of the greatest movies of all time.Thank you James Cameron.",10/10

This Scene Caused The Movie To Be Purely Commercial & Perhaps Rated R For Nudity.In My Opinion James Cameron's Movie Could Have Been So Much Better Without This Unnecessary Nudity Scene Unless He Wants To Attract People To Seeing It. We Know Very Much How Nudity & Sex Sells!.,1/10
Diminishing returns,Chrissie,10 April 1999,"I forget what prompted me to see Titanic for the first time -- I think it was a comment I read in an article by a Japanese man who said he was moved by the bravery of the men putting wives and children aboard lifeboats and telling gallant lies to comfort the little ones.See it I did, however, and I was so visually stunned I entirely missed how lousy the movie was.I went to see it a second time because my son had been reading about the Titanic and wanted to see how the sinking was depicted. This time I noticed how lame the characters and plot were.I went to see it a third time because a friend of mine who doesn't have a car asked me to bring him and offered to treat me and my kids to popcorn and sodas, and pay for our tickets, if I'd take him. That last time I left the theater absolutely outraged.Titanic is a sorry example of the moral decay of western civilization. Characters we were supposed to sympathize with were elbowing women and children out of their way to save their own miserable skins. Instead of reaching out to help the woman clutching a baby, Kate and Leo reminisce about the night they met. Leonardo hefts the worthless and shallow Kate onto the floating door to save her life, when he could have saved a dozen innocent children instead. Titanic was a monumental ego-trip and monument to selfishness. The only sympathetic characters were the designer, the captain, and the Irish widow with the two small children. I could smack Cameron in frustration -- imagine what a wonderful plot he could have built around this woman and Kate's shallow character! Picture it -- the widow flees Ireland to join her brother in America after the town rich creep offers to save her from poverty at the expense of her virtue. The widow sees Kate on the railing and gives her a picture of what suffering really is. Take it from there -- it can go in any number of directions far more interesting than the cookie-cutter lust story. Pathetic.As I told my kids on the drive home from the theater, ""If you every survive a shipwreck by ignoring the cries of drowning children, don't bother coming home.""",4/10
Amazing,laucon,23 February 2008,"I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it. But what I sometimes get annoyed at (and Man in the Iron Mask had the exact same problem) is that everyone is oohing and awwing at Leo's hotness when they don't realize the philosophy behind it. The real message of this movie is that if we knew what would happen tomorrow, there would be no point in living. We just have to take things as they come because there is no predicting what tomorrow will hold. So basically, caution is life's curse. Another philosophical message of this movie which is also political is that we have no control over the lives we're born into. We just have to make the best of them.

Titanic is the most beautiful and tragic story humans have ever told,tales-pizziolo,24 May 2023,"I first saw Titanic as a child and remember liking it, mom used to listen to the soundtrack at home growing up, then I saw the movie again in 2012 for the hundred year anniversary of the sinking and loved it, I actually became very obsessed with it back then and my high school friends even made fun of me for it. Then in February this year I watched it again in IMAX and was blown away. This movie does not get old. Such a masterpiece. At the end of the film the girl next to me cried for 5 minutes as the credits flew by. Not a dry tear duct in that cinema. THAT'S WHAT MOVIE MAGIC IS ALL ABOUT BABY! Something about Titanic reminds us all of true love. Jack and Rose's romance is true love put into action amidst class divides and tragedy. James Horner's score makes me Hornee, absolutely beautiful. I listened to the full soundtrack 10 minutes ago, and it's actually what prompted me to write this review.I think Titanic is my favourite film of all time...",10/10
An Unitentional Social Commentary,sschlenker,30 September 2008,"I'll start with the good in this movie- the production design and some of the supporting acting.Now the bad- pretty much everything elseEveryone says, no, you've got it wrong because it's truly beautiful. Well, I hate to break it to you, but I am a film lover who does like touching, beautiful dramas. I'm not some guy who sits around criticizing movies. But this is just disturbing. The message of this film is basically ""Americans can fall for soap-opera material that looks like a movie, and it can become the most overrated piece of trash of all time"". I mean seriously, it's just a really shallow and overly-touchy love story with really obnoxious tendencies to take itself waaayy to seriously. Honestly, James Cameron directed Terminator 2, which I thought was really fun and enjoyable because though it had a coherent story, it was purposely far-fetched and seemed to understand that. Titanic is three-and-a-half hours of pain-inducing mediocrity (except for the previously mentioned design), with completely over-the-top sappiness and the cheapest tricks in the book as far as getting a simple-minded audience to feel really tingly inside. And this won 11 Academy Awards? I've got a review for the only other movie to achieve this feat, Return of the King, which I didn't like either, but I've got to say it was better than this. My only question is, why, America? Why does crap like this become so acclaimed? I think the reason this won all those Oscars was its popularity. And why is it so popular? In conclusion, Titanic is a bad episode of Days of Our Lives with a little spicing-up of the visuals and a little more emotional manipulation. But it amounts to what should have been a little blip on the radar that everyone understood as mediocrity. Instead people consider this ""art"" and ""beautiful, powerful, compelling"". So the only productive thing this movie has really done is to show us that America has pretty low tastes in entertainment, and seems to think that it's somehow artistic.",2/10
I rewatched it in 3D and it was truly legendary!,jnahm,13 December 2022,"After its first debut in theatre in 1997, I went to see it 3 times. I rewatched it many many many times after that on CD, DVD, cables, streamings, etc. Probably more than 30 times already throughout these years. Last night, I rewatched it in 3D at home with 3D glasses and I'd have to say, the cinematography is truly legendary! The depth is amazingly on point considering that the film was shot far before 3D technology becomes popular. Cameron made a truly amazing film. The detail of those productions in the film also needs to be applauded. And in 3D, you can see the emotions of the actors and extras very clearly and thus, the emotion hits you in the face. The flooding scenes were very real.. actually, every scenes were so believable. I'm impressed again every time I rewatched it with the skills of this director.

Passing (or Sinking) Fad,fcurry,10 August 2001,How on Earth did James Cameron sign on to make this! Fortunately at least 1/3 of the film is spent on a not-so-bad sinking scene...but still that's no excuse for a twisted overrated love affair that desperately wants to be Gone With The Wind or Spartacus but falls victim to its plain stupidity. No one talks about this movie nowadays or even whimpers at the soundtrack anymore which REALLY ticks me off because these are the same people who saw this film 178 times. Hollywood should stick with budget-busting action films like Die Hard that have stayed popular for nearly two decades.,1/10
Romance that did not sank with titanic!,MuviFan73,24 September 2017,"The movie puts light on the romance that Jack and Rose shared. Although Jack died that night but the love he placed in her heart will not die till she is alive. Titanic is among the first Hollywood movies that I got to see on television. I like this movie from the day I first saw it. It is just not about the emotions of the characters in the movie but the emotions of people who watch it as well.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: I got to know about huge investment made in construction of sets, water bodies and their working. Well I would say they all got well along (4/5).Tone: Movie takes us on a ride where two people fall in love but one dies as titanic sinks. It is how Rose has those emotions still with her and would go away only with her death. As they call now grown old Rose to explore sank titanic to find lost jewel. The jewel is although with Rose and the secret that what she does of it will die with her. I would say it as epic romantic tone. (5/5).Music: The movie puts light on how the musicians on board were still performing as titanic was sinking. It captures your heart (3.5/5).Acting: Acting is good (3.5/5).Final Verdict: It is worth adding to your DVD collection [(4/5) (9/10)].",9/10
"""I believe you will get your headlines Mr.Ismay"".",amiranda-39274,7 May 2022,"Today marks the 110th anniversary of that tragic cold night the titanic sank and so many lost their lives. It is a small tribute, but i feel this movie and all the attention it gets, helps us all to remember and honor those who perished.I did not see titanic in theatres, in fact i actively avoided it for many years, because i heard it was a melodramatic chick flick. But I am so relieved now that i decided to rent it one day from my local video store and see why this movie had one of the biggest box office records ever. I was not ready. Not only was i engrossed, i was blown away by the epic scenes of this movie. The acting, the visuals, the action, the music, it just captured my cynical heart, it was in every word an EPIC, and here are the reasons why that is.The Story: we all know what happened on April 15th 1912, and despite that, this movie does a excellent job building up to that fateful moment. Planting so many easter eggs and comments that in hindsight, the dialogue seems prophetic. ""Not even God himself could sink this ship"". James Cameron takes care to include as many historical accurate individuals and occurrences on the ship, and they all occur around the fictional couple of jack and rose. Rose is a heiress traveling with her fiancee and mother, and feels that she is being shock by her extravagant but depressing lifestyle. Which is why Jack plays such a monumental role in her life as he provides her an escape from her old life. This love story is told by a 100 year old rose, who is revisiting her memories of her voyage aboard the titanic, to help a treasure hunting crew find the Heart of the Ocean diamond that she wore all those years ago.The Characters: Jack is a simple guy, a traveling artist who wants to see the world and live life to the fullest, his speech at dinner about how life is a gift describes perfectly the kind of man he is. Rose, is the main character of the film, she is a troubled soul, and she desires a life with no chains, after meeting jack, her growth from a proper lady to a badass is very smooth and she obtains the life she always wanted through struggle and determination. Billy zane is the perfect villain who should have played lex luthor (He was even bald!)he sees himself as royalty and looks down upon those who dont meet his perfection, despite this, he is a very likable character just not for the right reasons. Favrizzio is jacks italian best friend, and i feel he was cheated since there a lot of deleted scenes of him that makes him more of a character, in the end he was heroic for cutting the boats free but sadly still died. There are so many characters in this film worth exploring that the run time of this film is just not enough, which is why i always wished for a mini series(i know one aleady exist s but i want one with this cast). There are just so many wonderful characters in this film, that everytime i watch it, i focus on a different person. Many of the people seen on the boat were actual historical figures, that cameron does a great job bringing them back to life. Also, there are many instances of people doing things that actually happened in the film, such as the little boy playing with his father, foreign people not understanding whats happening, the band playing, and women jumping back on the ship to be with their men, its all so poetically tragic to see these people.The Ship: Yes the ship deserves its own character study, its the name of the movie for crying out loud. The design of the ship itself is fantastic, cameron truly spent every penny he had making the set look as glorious as it did when it first existed. James Cameron truly resurrected this great ship, that was worthy of its name ""The Titanic"". Everytime i watch the take off of the ship, i always feel i have been transported back in time, and i am aboard, filled with excitement and melancholy. The foreshadowing of the ships fate is just excellent with its creator, Mr Andrews commenting about the shortage of boats, the speeding up by the captain, despite the risk of icebergs. I love seeing every part of the ship explored, such as the scene where jack and rose are jogging through the boiler room and the lower decks. Of course this ship comes more to life when it begins to sink. Showing every level being filled with water until it reaches the top. The lighting of the water makes the sinking ship look so atmospheric. Cameron had to flood the set for real in order to capture this epic scope of every room being filled with water. Mr andrews represents the heart of the ship and how sad it feels to have failed to deliver its passengers to land. There are also so many striking visuals that bring the ship even more to life, such as a woman in a dress drowned. The mother and children and elderly couple in bed. Roses picasso paintings .the dishes shattering. That shot of hordes of people running up to the tip of the boat. The priest praying.the boat rising, just so many instances and visuals that elevate the tragedy of the death of titanic. She was a good ship, strong and true, but alas she died along with her passengers.The Music: My God the Music! What more can be said? While the lyrics and celine dions voice make the song ""my heart will go on"" one of the most emotional pieces ever, it is the instrumental theme that is unbearably melancholy to me when played in highly emotional scenes such as the kiss scene and the ending in heaven.Conclusion: There are so many genres in this film, a romance, a action thriller, a horror film, and a thought provoking film about not being afraid to live. This movie is so extra with the themes of horrors in the hallways and the action thriller with billy zane using a gun the flooding in the halls I will admit i am not a fan of the goodbye between jack and rose not because it sad but because its kind of laughable. After all the horror and sudden death, we are getting this long winded speech from jack. There are several issues i have with this movie, but none of them can over come the cinematic brilliance that Cameron accomplished. I never watched this movie in theaters, not even the re-releases, but by God do I want to do it now. I watch this movie every year on the anniversary of the sinking, in my own way this movie allows me to remember the ship and the people who died in the north Atlantic ocean. This movie will forever live in my memory.",8/10
ICEBERG Ahead?,ThunderKing6,25 November 2018,This movie is about a love story that ends by the hands of an evil iceberg.Titanic was more about romance then about tragedy. The old lady and Jack are pure fiction only the iceberg was real.I say enjoy a good hour of watching people suffer because of an iceberg.,6/10
It should be called 'Iconic',AmyJenson1995,24 February 2015,"When this picture came out in 1998, I was only a toddler but this movie will always be among my favorites. Each time I'm watching it, I'm always taken by the same array of emotions and it never changed. I'm still as impressed by the CGIs and the impressive work the staff accomplished to make this movie possible.Thanks to them, The Titanic, this gigantic British ship supposed to be unsinkable but did anyway during her ill-fated maiden voyage, came back to life and we can see how beautiful she was. Being able to recreate her to the smallest detail is certainly a great achievement and the result is as amazing as they could have imagined. It must have taken an incredible amount of research hours to reach this level of realism. The success of the picture is also the ones of all the people involved in this project. The sinking scenes are masterfully done but don't fell in the 'too much' view we always see in nowadays Hollywood movies. It's spectacular without being exaggerated and more interesting, James Cameron didn't take freedom with history.But the focus is not on the Titanic which is just the setting for a wonderful romance between Jake (Leo Di Caprio who is just so cute) and Rose (Kate Winslet who was the incarnated grace), two young people who weren't supposed to be together but fall in love and fought for survival together when the ship sinks in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. This romance looked like a fairy tale, It has everything to be a wonderful one: two young lovely people, who met on the ship unexpectedly, fall in love despite their rank differences (Jake is from common people, he is poor and succeeded to get on board thanks to a poker game. Rose is from the high bourgeoisie, a wife to be promised to a rich but jealous industrialist but is boiling inside by all the rules and etiquette). But when the ship collided with the iceberg and start sinking everything change and both Jake and Rose will try to survive together in a freezing Atlantic Ocean waters. What a powerful story.Today, 17 years after its release, Titanic is still a movie we are talking about. Some love and others hate but this movie is still in memories and I'm sure it's not willing to fade away. Leo and Kate are renowned actors and shoots with the greatest. And me, I'm still overwhelmed by the huge emotions this movie brings me. It's one of the kind and will have always a special place in my heart.",10/10
My favorite movie of all time,jeankarlrecords,5 December 2021,Without a doubt it is the movie that you can see on several occasions and you will not get tired of seeing it since there are many new details every time you see it.,10/10
Lame movie,curositykiller,22 July 2002,I hated this film it didn't have one single exciting part. The thing that made this movie so lame is that weather you are 100 or 1 you knew exactly what was going to happen and those are the boring kind of movies.,1/10
Waste of time,Tuck_Frump,3 January 2007,"I thought this movie was tremendously overrated. Considering the talent involved, it should have been a lot better. First of all, the movie went on way too long and although both great actors, DiCaprio and Winslett didn't match well together. In the kissing scenes I felt like I was watching a boy make out with his mother. I read somewhere that the Kate Winslett role was originally offered to Renee Zellweger, but that wouldn't have mattered because the entire movie was one big yawn. There were a few good scenes, but this movie should have only been an hour and a half to an hour and three quarters, not nearly three hours long. I also thought the lighting was really bad and the ship looked really fake in the water scenes. I am sure I am in the minority on this, but I would rather watch paint dry and listen to music than sit thought this entire movie again.",3/10
I Don't Have Many Doubts that This is the Most Overrated Movie of All Time,vittoriocosanostra,23 October 2020,"So, I think everyone knows, but in 1997 one of the most successful films of all time was released. And, it's called Titanic, and it was directed by James Cameron. This film won 11 Oscars in 1997 (including the best film) and had a box office success of titanic grandeur, one of the biggest in history, critically acclaimed, adored by the public and revolutionary for its special effects. Well, despite its undeniable legacy, there are reasons that, obviously, Titanic is not as perfect and wonderful as many people think, and that it does not deserve its Oscars or be selected as one of the best films of all time. The Oscar for best picture should definitely have gone to the fantastic L.A. Confidential, and that movie is way better than this silly melodramatic crap.",7/10
My all time favorite movie,sumeena-rakwal,26 May 2011,"I have seen the movie so many times that i remember the dialouges now. And every-time i see i feel like there is something new to it. It is the most amazing, wonderful movie i have ever seen. James Cameroon could not have got better actors than Leonardo and Kate Winslet to this movie. I have fallen in love with Jack since the first time i saw this movie. Never really occurred i could write a review about it, but today when i am watching it again and had my laptop just next to me thought of opening my heart. The music, gosh i have never loved background score of any movie as much i love Titanic's. The band that plays when ship is sinking, the song my heart will go on- well nothing needs to be said about that. I have been fantasizing this kind of love and romance ever since i saw this movie. It is one grand movie ever made, you cannot not like even a single part of this one. I really want Titanic to have a sequel in which Jack would come alive somehow with some logic or something. This movie took my heart away, its astoundingly beautiful and mesmerizing. Jack Dawson is my love and Titanic will remain my favorite movie ever.",10/10
Enough already,madchrisx,3 July 2001,"Stop talking about how great this movie is. It had a nice story, good acting, and good special effects. This is the most overrated movie in the history of film. People have forgotten the classics like Godfather, Gone With the Wind, and Star Wars. The story isn't that great because I knew exactly how it would end. The acting was the same as most movies and the special effects were pretty simple compared to most big budget movies that have been released in the past ten years. ** out of ****. Long live Star Wars!!!!",No Rating
Amazing visuals but far too long,CrazyArty,18 June 2022,The legendary disaster movie. Stars Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio as passengers on the fateful maiden voyage of the Titanic in 1912.I found the film far too long and it's really the sinking that you want to see for the amazing special effects. The romance story is a little contrived and I didn't find the leads that endearing.,7/10

Bravo to the ship & farewell to the main actors,Fiona G.,5 July 1999,"This was clearly a carefully done Titanic movie when we only talk about the ship: almost all technical details of the Titanic were perfectly done, including the way she possibly sunk. I just wish Cameron wouldn't have given in to the studio and have a soap-like story wrapped around the ship, and even worse, have the two main characters in it played by two shallow actors, who were clearly beyond their skills. Or to say it differently: bad main actors in bad roles gave the movie a perfect teenie audience but had the actual main factor of the movie lost: the ship.",5/10
Most overrated movie since the invention of film,kwa1063,11 August 1999,I cannot believe this movie won the Best Picture Oscar. I could've written a better script. The romance between Rose and Jack was totally unbelievable. We were supposed to believe that she was going to give up her spot in the lifeboat for this guy she met the day before? Please. The only redeeming value was the actual footage of the Titanic underwater. When the movie was over I couldn't have cared less about one person on that flippin' boat. Billy Zane's character was so overdone I kept expecting him to twirl a mustache and laugh maniacally. I saw an afternoon tv movie on Lifetime about Titanic that was better than this.,No Rating

Titanic Review - from Average Man Critic,Critic-46,13 August 1999,"Story -1.  We know the story... it was good.Characters -0.  I never really gave a damn about any of these characters, because the writer wasn't sure if he should make Jack be the main character or Rose.  And it's not like either of them were interesting.  He was a poor artist and she was a rich girl.Acting -0.  Dicaprio is the worst actor on the silver screen and since most of the time he acts like a homo, I can't picture him as a leading man. Blanchett is 2D as always.Beginning -1.  Started off as a promising big budget romantic story.End -0.  Your typical romantic love story.  Naturally somebody has to die and somebody has to live to give it that ""extra"" sad effect.  And since we knew from the beginning that the boat was gonna sink its not like there was ANY suspence.Score -1.  The musical score was great and added some drama to the movie.Attention Holding -0.  Not really.  The first hour and a half is the love stuff and the second is the action.  Very predictable.Memorable -0.  Just another love story.Could Watch Again -1.  If I had a different girlfriend and I needed a movie to hold her for 3 hours I would definetly choose this movie.

A real event,garry-r-richards,22 July 2005,"In many ways Titanic is a great movie. The effects are realistic enough to let you get right into it and the performances are generally very good; especially the gorgeous Kate who convinces with, or without, her kit on. It is a story of an ill fated but grand love affair. An unhappy heiress falls for a lovely poor guy over the rich, handsome, total bastard she's engaged to and trouble inevitably follows. This epic story is played out against the backdrop of a ship sinking which adds to the emotion, poignancy, hysteria and general tearfulness of it all and therein lies my problem with this flick.Before Titanic was a film it was a ship. Many real people died. Their families still remember. (yes even a century later), This movie is not a tribute or an insult. It is a disregarding of their memory. Jack and Rose could have had their moment in any one of a thousand scenarios. Why sully this tragic event?The sinking of the Titanic is a great historical tragedy. Not only death, but needless death, plus the loss of a magnificent machine, which was a tribute to human endeavour and ingenuity. The folly of her reckless handling in dangerous waters ( That's the ship, not Kate). The stupidity of man's ""unsinkable"" challenge to nature. The struggle of the crew to save as many people (especially rich ones) as possible. What a great film that could be (they tried to make it in 1958). A story that respected every gasp for air, every self sacrifice, every bloody engineer. Why did we need Jack and Rose? Is this the price we pay for Hollywood.",1/10
If you jump I jump,Feel-the-truth,15 January 2023,"I saw this movie at whilst at university, 1997 at a cinema in Kingston Upon Thames. The talk of the town was that this was the most expensive movie ever made and will flop, still being a fan of James Cameron, my friends and I went to see this movie.This movie had me glued to the screen, the chemistry between Jack and Rose was just wow. I still recall the last 90 mins of the movie, I watched the faces of my uni friends, every single one of the were in awe, no one blinked an eye lid.When the movie ended, we all sat in our seats for sometime before deciding to stand up and leave, the emotion was so vivid on everyone's face.I have seen this movie many times since and every time it leaves me with the same vivid emotions as I did in 1997.Titanic, Jack and Rose will never feel old to me.no matter how many times I was this movie.Titanic, is not a movie, its an experience, every human emotion is tested during the 3 hour plus runtime, I laughed, I sighed, I felt anger and I cried.",10/10
"Technical perfection, but not entirely convincing",roning,20 January 2001,"""Titanic"" is a technical masterpiece and the love story between Jack and Rose have got an epic touch. But somewhere the characters don't seem to fit into the time frame of the 1910:s. Maybe Cameron meant to put people with the 1990:s way of thinking and acting into another time, what do I know, but this really is the weakness of this exceptional movie. But, as I said, technically it would get top marks and every time I see it I get surprised that three hours have gone so fast.",7/10
Outstanding,Tito-8,13 June 1999,"The first half of this movie focused on a romance that I did not care about, and yet, I was still somehow engrossed by it all.  Rationally, I can understand that the story was fairly ordinary, but somehow, I was riveted. This is something that I cannot explain.  For every scene after the iceberg is first spotted, however, I can fully understand why I loved this movie so much.  The action scenes in this film are absolutely jaw-dropping, and this fact is the primary reason why this is one of my favorite films.  However, I can certainly agree with those who found this to be a real tearjerker. Seeing so many innocent people preparing to die is heartbreaking in the extreme, and these scenes will always stand out as some of the finest that I will ever see.  But make no mistake about it, I view this as an action film first, not as a emotional drama.  And since I view it this way, I strongly encourage action fans who somehow avoided this movie to give it a chance, because heart-pounding entertainment doesn't get any better than this.",10/10
I Still Can't Stop Thinking About It.,Zycho-3,30 August 2000,"I am sick of people saying this is a bad film. Get used to it, this was a breathtaking journey, it deserved all its 11 Oscars and all its success. I am extremely surprised that it isn't in the IMDb Top 250.I liked everything about this movie, the performances from Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates and Billy Zane were all impressive, but this time, the performances aren't the sparkle in the film. It is really the effort that went into the direction, visual effects, sound and sound editing and musical score that made the film such a sparkling, memorable gem.This is the best film of 1997 no doubt, and after which will soon be 4 years, I still can't stop thinking about this amazing achievement.Rating: 10",10/10
Truly brilliant - and the nth time viewing . . it sucks!,dust-7,23 October 1999,"Spoilers! (ahahh-ahh!! .. rememberin the late Sam K)This is a film which simply doesn't hold up upon repeated viewing. In fact, this is the only film I have, that I purchased, that seemed to get palpably worse each time I viewed it. Really, it SHOULD have won the Oscar. It's big budget, it has some good acting, great innovative effects, costumes and so on. Great film. But then it was a very weak year (has been for a couple of years).Maybe it's that the sob scenes are SO calculated, that the effect or novelty is exposed 2nd/3rd time around. Maybe the flying prow scene just seemed too set-up. Maybe, truly, after seeing the film, the next time, or time after that, when you see it, you think of the real deal, the real ship, the real sinking, and wonder if the Irwin Allen treatment, here, isn't just a little too cynical and a little bit too much blood-money for the film-makers? I don't know.The 'docu-scenes' that bracket the film will probably hold up the best. The 'Heaven' scene depends on the emotion sweeping you up, and that of course is lost on repeat viewing (but that would be expected). If the film were about something fantastical, unbelievable, wild adventure or weird sci-fi, it could be viewed over and over without a thought given to reality. If it were a character play, from Jane Austen to Shakespeare, it could be repeatedly view precisely for the insights into reality, and appreciated for the fantasy, as well. But this is just Poseidon Adventure, with superficial character studies, and a quick sinking (cause it was) that leaves little time for Shelley Winters, er (whoever), to put in a 'just help me get off of this tub', performance (or was 'Jack' playing Shelley Winters? - ?).Almost gave the film away to a friend. Almost threw it out. Was surprized I still had it on the shelf. Don't plan to view it anytime soon.",No Rating
Stare at a blank wall for 3+ hours. Better use of your time.,RootBoy,25 January 1999,"While I will admit that the special effects were pretty good (they better be for $280 million) the rest of the movie was absolutely horrible.  The most believable performance in the film was by the Iceberg.  The characters were entirely plastic, and I felt no sympathy for any of them when they died.We have Selfish Brat Rose, who decides that she is going to get what she wants no matter what her parents say. She even laughs when her much older self tells of her Fiance's suicide. She changes her name and allows her mother to think she is dead; not a word of hope for the poor mother of Rose. Not to mention that despite its size, she must have the ENTIRE board to herself when she and Jack are in the water.  Whatever happened to ""you jump I jump?""  Wouldn't they have been able to keep warmer if they had been huddled together?  It seems she forgot to mention this 2 day incident of true love to her eventual husband of some 80 odd years too. Hmmm....Then we have Over-glorified-Representation-of-Freedom Jack, a ""gentleman"" who doesn't bother to s**** Rose in the bedroom when she is naked, but waits until they are in the backseat of a car (now isn't THAT romantic!). Wouldn't a true ""gentleman"" (especialy one of that era) not have done anything at all?  Great job of accurately representing the time period, James...The acting was indeed bad, but I cannot entirely blame the Actors for this. It is hard to make stupid one-liners (such as ""this is bad"" when the ship is vertical) sound good, and kudos to Cappy for trying.The success of this movie at the box office is not too hard to understand. I know at least 7 people who saw it 5 or more times each, and have heard of others who have seen it more, but how anyone at the academy could have thought it deserved any NOMINATIONS other than perhaps Best effects is beyond me.",1/10
"""Titanic"" can't remain afloat.",jreyes-2,1 May 2000,"Much has been made of director James Cameron's attention to detail. Ironically, Leonardo Dicaprio seems incredibly 90's in his demeanor and appearance.  Additionally, his hand is perfectly manicured and ages some 20 years when he sketches Kate Winslet later in the film.  The story line is borrowed from ""For Whom the Bell Tolls""; and, the effects are only okay. Low budget genius like John Carpenter and Able Ferera could have made this film much better with a fraction of the budget.

Are there folks out there who have never seen the movie in theater, on TV, on DVD or VHS ? Are there folks that don't know the story? Makes me chuckle. But I digress.... This movie is one of the best ever made and I was thrilled to see it again on the big screen. I do not believe the 3D adds anything to the film, as much of it is still in 2D with the 3D element in either the foreground or back round. I am not that observant to notice that the brightness of the film is 20% diminished due to wearing the glasses, as others have mentioned. I am spell bound by the story telling.... documentary/love story/action disaster movie. I have see this movie more times than I can count , including no fewer than 8 times in the theater when it first came out. I still cry every time, starting when Jack takes rose flying off the bow of the ship, heightening when the string quartet starts playing ""Nearer,My God, to Thee"" and I don't stop until after the credits roll. Every element of this film holds your interest, characters are spot on, once the sink sequence starts it is edge of your seat, heart pounding as you see special effects that you can't believe before your eyes. And for me personally, shout out to the costume/wardrobe outfitters because I love the clothes in this movie. Cameron's attention to detail is unmatched. Bravo to his work ethic!

Romantic vehicle involving Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio plus some simplistic message about oppression of the poor .,galba3-1,29 March 2006,"I had the misfortune to be taken to see this film and spent an agonising three hours with the will to live seeping away from me all the time, so what's wrong with it? DeCaprio, from a purely unbiased mans view I can see the appeal to the more uncritical female section of the audience, however he was totally acted off the screen by the glorious Kate Winslet. This is not the first time consistently he is given parts that most actors would kill for only to find himself completely upstaged by much better actors, remember Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet, Daniel Day Lewis in that abomination Gangs of New York. I rest my case. The soundtrack by Celine Dion left me with the urge to scream with tedium, good voice shame about the material! The film is over long and I can not see the necessity for the length the plot certainly didn't present any challenges or surprises. The Titanic disaster in reality was about people and peoples responses differed to the in relation to it, it was not only the rich who were cowardly and oppressive in reality there was a lot of bravery shown as well, in other words HUMANITY at its best and worst. I found the Hollywood gross oversimplification at best insulting at worst the stereotype portrayed about the Irish deeply insulting and approaching racist. In summation I would say that the experience was something similar to visiting a slightly dementing older relative and being left alone in their company for a day. The relationship between DiCaprio and The glorious Winslet (OK I'm Biased) could not carry the entire film especially given its length.

An expression of dislike and stupefaction,OLAF21,5 October 1999,"I know I am at a risk of being looked upon as an unrescuable geek, but I did not like this movie. Yes, I am the one. People around me kept telling me it is a great, romantic and anguishing movie. I found  none of this in there. It is obvious from the start (from her surroundings at home) that Winslet has survived without her love, that she has lived her whole life in memory. But on a more technical side, I found the Fx lacking the immaculate touch that was needed (and, by many, seen) to create the real feeling of the disaster. Signs of bad Fx are everywhere, from the boat's surrounding water to the people falling from the deck once it has gone vertical. It all feels fake, and that is for me an instant turn-off. I also failed to see the magic between the two main actors, although I do think DiCaprio is a good actor, and Winslet is usually OK, at least for me. Only, not here. So here I am, out of curiosity having finally seen a movie everybody thought wonderful, and feeling very disappointed. Missing any suspense from the situation, and non-thrilled by the love-story, I found myself wondering what all the people saw in there that I did not. All I saw was a vain effort to boost an empty plot with a shallow historical pretext. If anybody would like to discuss it further (and calmly), the signature is my address.",No Rating
Power of Love,dostuaricardo,14 May 2019,"Extraordinary love story and very touching heart. it's one of the best films I've ever watched. I don't know how to explain my feelings. oh god, this film makes me shed tears. even now when I watch this film again, it can't be felt not to shed tears. it is rare for me to feel this kind of feeling that is even difficult to express. I have never been bored to watch it repeatedly and even the power of the film hasn't diminished in the slightest, even though this movie has been released for quite a long time. maybe there are only a few films in this world that make the audience take part in feeling the story in this film.When I first watched this movie, I cried and didn't know what to say, I thought it was an amazing film with a storyline that couldn't be guessed and there were not only sad parts but also parts that could make laughter so that this film not flat and not boring. Until now it was the best film in my life, no single film could match it.
This film for me there are many grooves so we have to really pay attention from the beginning so that no part is missed so we will feel the intention to convey this film. I think this film has been very perfectly made with technological sophistication which at that time was very extraordinary. I think this character by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is extraordinary, they are like being able to be interconnected and truly like love stories in the real world. young couples who face complicated love stories in the middle of a different background, full of struggles and challenges that must be faced but with the power of love all can be passed.I think this will be the best film of all time that will never be forgotten.",10/10
James Cameron was wrong,bookandcandle,13 August 2021,"Rose could have saved Jack's life by allowing him to share the board with her. All they had to do was to tie Rose's life jacket around the board, so that there would be enough buoyancy to keep their bodies above water. James Cameron wanted Jack to freeze and drown, and that was a bad decision on his part. No one wants to watch a long movie and have lovers parted in a flimsy, insensitive and selfish scene. So, the ending ruined the entire movie for me...it just did. James Cameron must enjoy watching people leave a movie feeling betrayed and deceived by Rose. True love by Rose...not in my eyes. Plus, Jack would never have met Rose. The first and second class passenger decks were had gate locks from the third class passenger decks due to immigration and health laws. Total non-fiction. If you are going to make a historical drama, then you have to do your homework because people will believe what you have presented to them.",1/10
Not worth the money spent on it! The first movie in the history that cost $200M and made for children!,_Sergey_,3 July 1999,"Very disappointed with this one. The worst ever casting simply adds more stupidity to the already thoughtless plot. I would expect more from the movie that cost more than $200,000,000. The special effects are very expensive but primitive and not really necessary for the movie.Do not get me wrong, the movie is not SO bad. It is just not worth (art-wise) the money spent on it. The movie's qualities are of a middle level. There are hundreds of movies like this one. The only thing that is special here is the budget.Bottom line: I watched the movie once (well almost once, it is way too oversized, I could not make it through the whole movie) and this is enough for me!",1/10
Such a beautiful film!,colm-hearne365,19 March 2016,"Frankly I don't care what cynical people say about Titanic whether they say it's overrated or it's too long or it didn't deserve to be one of the highest grossing movies of all time or it didn't deserve to win 11 Oscars. I mean I'm a guy and I'm not ashamed to say Titanic moved me to tears and is one of my favourite movies. There is a reason why it won Best Picture at the Oscars as well as many other rewards. It takes the tragic story of Titanic and mixes with a classic love story as well as adventure and some horror and turns it into a film that is so beautiful to look at. Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson and Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater make such a wonderful and beautiful couple and act their parts perfectly. The movie is also brilliantly directed by one of my favourite directors, James Cameron and this is up there with his other masterpieces like Avatar, Terminator 2 and Aliens. Not to mention the music matches well with the movie thanks to the work of James Horner's score especially with the love scenes. But even a movie as sad and tragic has a happy ending. Like I know people didn't like how it ending or thought it was confusing but I mean it actually that old Rose died in her sleep and she's with everyone who died on the Titanic, including Jack of course. So in conclusion, if you've never seen Titanic and you like movies, prepare to have a new favourite movie.",10/10
This movie is a moving tribute to all who were part of the real Titanic disaster!,showbiz-2,10 October 1998,"I attended this movie prepared to see a another blockbuster rip-off. There have been many. Disappointing run of the mill stuff, each like the other in content and movement. From the start this movie was different. What impressed me the most was the accurate detail involved in both the sets and the telling of the story. It's central story about two lovers destined to be torn apart by events taking place around them, is never boring. More important is the telling of the ship's disaster itself.With breathtaking special effects the movie viewer is brought onto the ship and made to feel a part of the on-going action. Mr. Cameron has given us a closer look than we have ever had, or probably ever will have, at what happened that fateful night of it's sinking. To coin a term from another well made movie on the subject, it is truly, ""√Ñ Night To Remember.""Thanks to James Cameron caring and skill and excellent performances all around, this is a picture to be proud of, and a tribute to an event that should never be forgotten in the annals of history.",No Rating

This movie was also way too long for a love story!  If you want to see a good love story see What Dreams May Come!  Due to this film, I now dislike the name Cameron, and that's pretty bad coming from someone who loved Abyss, Terminator2, and Aliens, to put it simply I hated this film!",1/10
Titanic,oOoBarracuda,28 April 2016,"Rounding out a three-way tie for most Academy Award wins, James Cameron's 1997 Best Picture-winning film Titanic, was as massive in scope as the doomed titular White Star liner. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet join together to tell the story of the most well-known nautical disaster of the 20th century. Cameron takes some liberties with the telling of the disaster, largely through the injected romance between a young aristocrat and a struggling artist. The story is told in sweeping Cameron fashion, that he is well known for, through a beautiful juxtaposition of tragedy and doomed courtship. Boarding the luxurious R.M.S. Titanic with her family and fianc√©, Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) feels like she is in shackles boarding a slave boat. The beautiful young woman of 17 is being married off to a man that views her as property and a reflection of himself rather than a person to build a life with. Once the ship docks in Philadelphia, Rose is to marry Caledon 'Cal' Hockley (Billy Zane), a wealthy oil businessman in a union arranged by her mother Ruth Dewitt Bukater (Frances Fisher). Rose has no attraction or interest in building a life together with Cal, and their marriage is seen as a way out of the financial difficulty the death of Rose's father has brought to their family. While pondering her future plight along the ship deck, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor vagabond who won his ticket on the liner in a poker game locks eyes with her. Instantly smitten, Jack's new role is to break social barriers and explore a romance with Rose. Jack finally gets his chance when he talks Rose off the ledge of the ship one night when she is consumed by despair over her upcoming nuptials and sees suicide as the only way out. Being invited to dinner with Cal and Rose's family as a gesture of thanks for his being at the right place at the right time, Jack borrows a suit and charms Rose. Knowing how she feels about her life and fianc√©, Jack stops at nothing to convince Rose that they can endure a relationship with each other filled with love and the mutual freedom Rose so desires. The story of the doomed love is told through 101-year old Rose after her necklace has been found aboard the sunken wreckage by a team of excavators led by Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton).Taken at what it is, Titanic is a wonderful film. Cameron beautifully juxtaposes the romance along with the historically accurate depiction of the ship's voyage. The film is heavy on romance, however, and if that's not your preferred genre you will struggle to look past it and focus on the history alone. The film looks as beautiful as it sounds, which is no easy feat given the subject manner. The elegant music accompanies the riches that shine through the set and cinematography in a perfect union. Leonardo DiCaprio is wonderful in the film and walks the line between boyhood charm and adult charisma that can be counted on quite well. As good as Winslet was in the role, she seemed miscast for the part. Her mature beauty was difficult to accept as a 17-year-old young woman. The chemistry between the two actors, however, was magical, and may be the reason to overlook Winslet not being believable as a teenager. Class and social standings are mainstays of exploration throughout the film. Rose loves art, and Jack is an artist in the time where even Pablo Picasso's works are looked upon as infantile, with Cal proclaiming that he ""will never amount to a somebody"". In a world that only accepts one way to live and one idea to live up to, Jack and Rose can't find a place to fit in, which is only made better by them finding each other; and really, who can't relate to the feeling of being an outsider in the world in which they live?",8/10
Did I use to like that movie?,Calysta,19 January 2000,"It was the most amazing movie two years ago, but in 2000, the flawed fiction account of the most famous ship in history seems overstatingly unbelievable. Attempting to be faithful to fact while making Leonardo look overwhelmingly good to drag girls around my target age group to the box office now makes me embarrassed to be once part of the phenomenon that once was. Unfortunately, fact could not combine with romance on that one with a director who seemed more intent of running bills into the millions of dollars to break into the record books.I will not be entirely venomous towards the movie, because it was after all, at one stage, my favourite movie. Kate Winslet's performance was perhaps the best in the whole film, but her lower key and lower profiled Oscar nominated performance in ""Sense and Sensibility"" as Marianne still exceeds this one entirely. She has a knack for costume period drama in a good showy part, but she has done better work elsewhere.What once seemed to be perfection of movie making is quickly becoming evident with its misconceptions of film making. The screenplay at the time, and the musical score seemed completely breathtaking, but now merely looks the complete fluke that had enough star drawing power to get people to hand over their cash to the box office. Celine Dion assaulting the world with a maudlin ballad about a sinking ship of course increased the movie's success to a greater extent than it deserved. Perhaps the art decoration, costume design and cinematography will outlast some of the mediocre elements disguised beneath the surface of the gloss. The ""Titanic"" hype lasted long enough to secure a record equaling amount of Oscars first reached in 1959 with ""Ben-Hur"". During the 1990s, the Academy seemed to be handing the best picture statuette to the wrong pictures, with the exception of ""Schlindler's List"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Without a doubt, it will retain its place in history as a movie epic for all the generations. But it is certainly no ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""Casablanca"", and in sixty years we'll be wondering what we were thinking.

Awesome recreation of a tragic event...the love story is slim...,Doylenf,14 April 2001,"I've looked back through the other comments posted here and can't believe I saw the same film some of these disgruntled ""critics"" are talking about. What's so wrong about telling a love story against the background of a real-life historical event? Since when is there a restriction on poetic license? Get real. 'Titanic' is an extremely impressive movie from every standpoint in recreating an actual ship disaster that took more than a thousand lives. Told in a flashback technique, it focuses mainly on Jack and Rose and their unlikely meeting when she attempts suicide--but also draws in a number of other characters that are equally well integrated into the plot. The class distinction that existed then (and now) is shown with clarity--making complaints from previous ""commentators"" meaningless when they say that the film doesn't even deal with this factor. The snobbery was there and is most fully exposed in the depiction of Rose's class-conscious mother. TITANIC will go down as one of the greatest recreations of an actual event ever attempted on screen--masterful in all departments. The performances, from leads to bit players, are uniformly excellent--but no one has given enough credit to Billy Zane. He's the perfect villain and plays his juicy role with incredible skill and zest. All those protesting that this film is a disaster are simply mouthing hollow words, all sound and fury signifying nothing. If it's cool to knock this movie, so be it. But their appraisal of it is far from the truth and they are quite clearly in denial.The Jack/Rose love affair is the weakest development in the script but at least it does point up the class distinction that played a large part in this human tragedy.",No Rating
Possibly the WORST movie of the decade.,Delerium,23 May 1999,"Yeah, you heard right. Titanic, for all it's special effects, obscenely high budget, and no less criminal amount of critic acclaim, is nothing more than a big pile of rubbish. The ship sank, and sucked millions of dollars down with it.First of all, take away the special effects. What your left with is a third rate script. It attempts to mix a period piece with trendy, all too modern dialogue. I have doubts that ""The finger"" and the term ""Bum a smoke"" existed in 1912. You also get the most contrived love story in the history of motion pictures. There is no way Jack would have even been allowed near where Rose was. Also, I doubt that a girl like Rose, raised in a life of luxury and set to marry a billionaire, would be interested in a bum like Jack. The customs at the time would not have permitted it. What I also have a problem with is the cliches that this script banks on. It is always the rich people who are the villains, and the poor little popper is the hero who saves the day. The screenwriter must have no mind of his/her own.Second, the acting is horrible. Sorry ladies, it's no mystery why Leo wasn't nominated for an Oscar. But Leo can act, he has proven that in the past. But period pieces are not his strength (do I even need to mention ""The Man in the Iron Mask""?). Kate Winslet is the typical strong willed female character made to appeal to the feminists watching this movie. They might have had their feathers ruffled by the lines ""The real purpose of college is to meet a good man"", though. She is good, but one good performance in a sea of bad ones.James Cameron is not high on my list of favorite directors, and ""Titanic"" stands as the biggest stroke of his ego. Needless to say, I was disgusted by the ""Moment of silence"" he made at the Oscars. The only redeeming quality of ""Titanic"" is watching the ship sink, which fills the second half of this movie's grossly overlong running time. But it is hardly worth it. And the Best Picture Oscar, god! There is only one way I can say this, ""LA Confidential"" got screwed! As did ""Good Will Hunting"".To sum up, I found my 3 hours in the dentist chair last month more enjoyable than this piece of trash. There's a special place in Hollywood Hell for ""Titanic"".",1/10
how beautiful are these stars under these cold waters!,lolitalots,19 January 2022,"Back in 1912, the largest, most beautiful liner, the Titanic, set off from Great Britain to America on its first voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. A journey that became his last.Director James Cameron, who went to this film for many years, managed to turn this dramatic, terrible event into a film that became not only dramatic, but also romantic, which made this film a cult film.After all, by chance, a young, seventeen-year-old girl Rosa (Kate Winslet) and her mother sailed on this ship, who were in for a difficult financial situation in the future, because Rosa's mother did not want to go to work as a seamstress (and what's wrong with that?). To get out of this situation, she wants to marry her daughter of convenience to a young man who is sailing on the same flight with them. And from the numerous passengers, a figure, the image of Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), comes to the fore. This is a young twenty-year-old poor artist who ended up on this ship, as if pulling out a lucky ticket. But was he happy?People of different classes. But is it possible between them an unexpected romantic first true bright love, which will wipe clean all the boundaries, barriers, which in fact may not exist between people? When Jack changes his suit for a jacket, sits down to dinner with Rosa's family, having earned the right to this by a certain noble deed, here he is - the same person as they are. Maybe all people are equal. Now they all sail the same way on this liner across the ocean.Or maybe internal qualities are important in a person, which will be revealed most clearly and clearly in an unusual, dangerous, extreme situation?And if in him, a poor artist who had a difficult past, it is not clear what the future would be, there is a spiritual beginning coming from his profession, which made him a romantic, with whom Rosa fell in love, a huge number of spectators were imbued with sympathy after her. And it was this role of Leonardo DiCaprio, played by him in his youth, that became one of the best in the actor's career. For this romanticism. Especially when Jack and Rose stood together on board the Titanic in the last rays of sunset, when the sea is so beautiful, when there is still silence and peace and harmony. But this is a symbolic transition between day and night, between joy from the luxury of the ship, its greatness, from the wonderful time of dancing on it to night. But this night is destined to become sad, fatal. Iceberg in these cold waters is getting closer.And here is an extreme situation. When passengers understand that this first trip of the liner will be the last. And their lives are in danger. How the scenes are shown at night on the ship, when people are trying to escape. Where is salvation? In boats? And if a loved one remained handcuffed? What can a girl do for him? For the most heroic deed. It is shown what a person feels when he is alone, in the midst of this grandeur and luxury, which is already doomed. Water flows all around. Do you need to keep moving towards your goal? It is in these conditions that the character of a person is revealed: nobility, courage, determination. Girls have these qualities too. And what people feel together on deck. The same panic. When it becomes obvious to some that it is necessary to stay on the ship as long as possible. And if he starts to take a vertical position. How defenseless these people are! And how you need to love and cherish this life, every moment! And do not leave a person in trouble! If only all the characters in the film understood this!And already in the middle of the dark night, the cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean will be near. But how beautiful are these stars under these cold waters!""Titanic"" teaches that as on a ship during this interval, which should have been short, but became infinity, all people in the world are equal. And you need to love and take care of each other, cherishing every moment of life.I like this one.",9/10

I think this movie are fantastic.,watcharawitboon,17 March 2023,"Many people may be familiar with the romantic love story between Jack and Rose from the well-known film Titanic. James Cameron is both the producer and the director of the film. The real-life incident of the RMS Titanic colliding with an iceberg on April 14, 1912, when the ship was sunk, served as the basis for this tale. That led to numerous deaths, which added to the tragic love tale of a man and a lady that many people still remember today. It also added to the sadness at the time.The part in this movie that most impressed me was when Jack was talking to the billionaires seated at the dinner table while telling them about his own life, despite the fact that Jack is only a commoner. And never enjoyed a fine meal, but Jack was skilled at doing it. The talk flowed well, and the wealthy individuals enjoyed Jack's humor. Make every minute of your life count is one of Jack's movie statements that struck a chord to me and served as a judgment in real life.Despite the fact that the movie's premise is a drama that invites many people to get bored because of the love story of two individuals, the story is kept interesting for more than three hours, allowing spectators to enjoy the story without becoming bored. This is common in many dramas, but the scenes here look fantastic and the two performers' skills give the film an impeccable appearance. The movie took home a number of honors, including the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Direction, Best Visual Effect, and Best Production and Design, among others.Along with the outstanding stories previously mentioned, the soundtrack, which includes the award-winning song ""My heart will go on,"" is something else that should not be missed. Numerous awards, as well as films, because this song is strong and matches the tone of the film perfectly.And I think the artist who performed ""My Heart Will Go On"" had a wonderful and strong voice. Make this song a financial contributor to the success of this film. Help improve the appearance of this film's overall aesthetic Another legend among the world's most beautiful tunes has been started by this song. Millions of individuals favor it Everyone in the world, in my opinion, has heard this song because it has become a global hit.In conclusion, I'd like to state that the Titanic movie is regarded as a film that produced another legend since it was enjoyable and suitable for everyone, however this may not be true given the circumstances. If you don't enjoy a movie from the start, sitting through a longer-than-3-hour film could feel like torture. And this movie's plot is regarded as having a good movie. The movie is by James Cameron, and it is magnificent and pays attention to every detail.",10/10

That year, people like Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon were nominated and for good reason, they know how to act.The rest of the cast in Titanic was brilliant.  They portrayed people from early this century.  In contrast, DiCaprio came acted like some ""aw shucks"" kid from 1997.  He didn't blend at all making his performance the weakest part of this film.

All for sensationalism and turned into a mega-soap opera. Focusing on the plight of two 1990's teenagers decked out in costumes as if they inhabited 1912 but nobody was fooled. The whole thing was ludicrous as they slogged their way for hours in freezing ocean water in soaked clothing, ending up in the ocean of course -- but only she was saved. The only good part of this movie ""disaster"" was the first few minutes where they showed the salvage operation on the real Titanic.",2/10
Titanic is a film that surprises me with its quality every time I watch it.,Offworld_Colony,17 February 2020,"The problem with these iconic blockbusters that worm their way in to culture, is that their lasting image burned in to my brain is one of the fan culture, the parodies, the awards, the ripple of films influenced for decades after, and the legacy of the filmmakers and the technology going forwards, all which overshadow the actual merits of the film itself and eventually taint it in my mind; almost like a kind of warped reverse/retconned-hype.Titanic is an elegant harmony of period drama and destruction porn. With a 70/30 split of the action in the back-end like theatre. Managing to weave his underwater interests in to a tragic love story in a Shakespeare vein gives it a quintessential classical Hollywood feel. There's some cheesy acting and dialogue but it's all in keeping with the blockbuster ethos; Cameron's on-the-nose dialogue (clearly trumped up by ghost-writers here) fits the classic nature of the film and produces some memorable, quotable lines.Cameron clearly knows wonder and spectacle, but also attention to detail and minutiae; the examinations of the microcosm of class, the revelry in such feats of engineering and artistry. Titanic, adopting a sublimely classic structure, manages a marriage of all these elements very well. It jumps through time elegantly, crossing over tacitly also in to excavation drama and faux-biopic.There's a tangible (read: expensive) earthy quality to the authentically constructed sets and meticulous and completely fashionable costumes. And the superb editing enhances the tactile nature of the film. Cameron really knows pacing in this film; always paced just right, never languid, never passing over the important moments, almost no scene that doesn't serve a purpose; the film's breathing room allows for many callbacks and twists and turns and it can be genuinely tense at times. Again, elegance is the word that comes to mind, a perfect synthesis on shooting and editing style and subject matter.The audio has real range depending on where the characters are standing, I noticed archways or covered areas changing the aural landscape and it's got some properly wistful and hummable music (which you want in the theme) even if the music sometimes sounds like the start of the Home Alone theme, or whatever other Christmas move I kept seeing in my head when the music began.The picture is superb. In fact it may be the best I've ever seen. It's a pristine image that looks like you're perring through the cleanest window you've ever seen. It's a masterclass in image reconstruction. The lighting is also lovely, timeless, pretty but not too saccharine, the night shots still impressive. The 3D is cautious but sumptuous. Never gratuitous and never party to ghosting or too many jarring planes of 3D image intersecting. It's clear that Cameron was always interested in framing his shots with many layers which lends itself perfectly for this kind od post-post-conversion. There's a mirror shot featuring Billy Zane and his Manservant that exhibit the quality of the original shooing and the 3D conversion all at once.The effects still hold up, some are noticeable but not as jarring as some techniques used a decade later. At this time, effects; visual and special, motion capture, matte paintings, miniatures and CGI were all used and blended only when it would have looked its best, represented the best intention of the director. Watching the extras of Titanic alongside the extras of The Hobbit it's depressing how these effects work, particularly mocap and CGI that is now used largely to cut corners on set, or make up for a lack of script, or to cut costs.In terms of acting, DiCaprio solidifies himself as a charming but cool, real and tangible loveable young tyke, his believable, youthful, effortless acting a joy to watch. Winslet goes through the best arc; her character perfectly embodying both the uptight and the energy of youth, she has real nuance and layers that come out of her character. But it's Zane that I love the most. He's superbly hilarious, watching him a riot, an actor understanding his role perfectly. I am fascinated by Zane who plays a man perfectly from his time; the relaxed air of privilege. He's not mean or evil, he just has edge; he's just exactly a product of the time and his class. He's not even a bad sport, with a knowing sense of humour and a desperate human element.In conclusion, Titanic is a film that I couldn't see it that often, but when I've forgotten the clich√©s and the well studied beats of it, it's a surprising film of great technical prowess, with gravitas and charm by the bucket-load. It's memorable and a brilliant synthesis of themes and genres. It is expertly crafted cinema in the traditional sense. And in light of recent massive, world-altering tragedies it even takes on new light and new importance as a very raw and emotional product.",10/10

I'm not saying he's a bad filmmaker, his kind of directing can have great results (Aliens, The Abyss, The Terminator) and not so great results (this film).

"Overrated? Slightly, But Not By Much",MadReviewer,15 May 2001,"`Titanic' has a large number of fans that will cheerfully proclaim that it is the best movie ever made, and a large number of detractors who will cheerfully proclaim that is nothing but puerile, overrated garbage.  The truth lies somewhere in between - `Titanic' definitely shouldn't have won the Best Picture Oscar in 1997 (), but to dismiss the film as utter crap is very unfair.  `Titanic' tells a complex tale, and, for the most part, tells it very well.  The fact that parts of this tale are either predictable or flawed shouldn't be ignored, but it also isn't enough to turn `Titanic' into a rotten movie. `Titanic' has a slightly predictable story, but most films involving a well-known historical event tend to be predictable.  Before the movie even starts, anybody watching `Titanic' should be able to predict a few things: The Titanic will set sail in glorious fashion, with its owners grandly proclaiming its unsinkable nature; there will be a story about the passengers, some fictional, some real; the Titanic will sink in a slow and horrible fashion; and while the ship sinks, the characters will be forced to deal with their own mortality, and some will be heroes while others will be craven cowards.  See?  Predictable.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that the historical nature of `Titanic' dictates this story structure. After all, it's the structure James Cameron actually uses.  But the execution of that structure . . . well, that takes some talent, if the film has any aspirations of being good.  It means blending action, romance, drama, and historical accuracy.  And James Cameron blends them all splendidly.The main story concerns a young girl named Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), traveling to America in order marry an arrogant millionaire named Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).  The marriage, which has been arranged by her formerly rich and now-destitute mother (Frances Fisher), is abhorrent to Rose, so in a desperate attempt to escape her fate, she attempts to jump off the ship.  Of course, she doesn't jump, but is instead saved by the happy-go-lucky Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), and of course the two begin a brief, if implausible, romance.  This romance, which is perhaps the weakest part of `Titanic' is still vitally important to the story . . . because it gives the audience a very strong reason to care about these characters when the ship hits the iceberg, and about the choices they make. Could it have been better?  Absolutely.  But considering that the romance is a means to an end, rather than the end itself, it's not bad.DiCaprio is superb as the wide-eyed vagabond Jack Dawson - he brings enough earnest enthusiasm to the role to make it totally believable as to why Rose would fall in love so quickly with him.  Winslet's slightly less believable, though; she's good, but not great.  She puts in a nice, quiet, restrained performance, but it's so restrained at times that it borders on comatose. It's actually the minor characters that add some zip to `Titanic' - Billy Zane is outstanding as the villain Hockley, as he gives Hockley enough human nuances to make him seem like a flawed, arrogant person, and not just some standard bad guy ripped straight out of a Flash Gordon serial.  Also worthy of note is the modern-day interaction between deep-sea explorer Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and the elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart), floating on an exploration ship far above the watery grave of the Titanic.  No only does their interaction serve as a brilliant, unobtrusive way of relaying the historical facts about the Titanic's final hours to the audience, but Paxton also manages to become a surrogate for the audience - as the movie unfolds and gets more and more interesting, it's a neat touch to see his character Lovett become more and more fascinated with Rose's stories.It would be remiss not to mention the special effects of `Titanic', which by and large is the film's strength. While the ship (and its sinking) is a product of CGI effects and model works, it's done it such a realistic manner that it never calls attention to itself, or reminds the audience that they're watching a movie. Of more importance is that the film's effects, while spectacular, never ARE the film - they always SUPPORT the film's story.There are many things to nit-pick about `Titanic' (although I find it hard to believe that people really nit-pick the minor historical inaccuracies of the film; Cameron got all the major details right, and the films probably more than 95% accurate, for crying out loud).  But those problems are nit-picks - very tiny but slightly irritating details, nothing more.  They keep the film from being an all-time great, but they certainly don't make it a bad film.  The blend of romance, action, history, and special effects probably explains the film's vast appeal - there's certainly something for everyone in this film - and it also makes `Titanic' an excellent, if not perfect, movie.

"OK, but still Cameron's worst movie",Idocamstuf,25 April 2003,"This movie is not great, its just OK, especially considering that it won so many awards, and was directed by James Cameron, whose made several masterpieces(both Terminators, Aliens, and The Abyss), which were all much, much better than this.  This film had several flaws, overlength, sucky acting(Leonardo that's you) to name a few.  When I think of a James Cameron film, I think of heart-pounding thrills, and a little bit of blood to add a little extra interest.  It just annoys me how James Cameron is known for this movie, when his other movies were so much better, especaially the criminalally underrated ""The Abyss"".

5. People in 1912 spoke and thought exactly like people in the 1990s.

3. Poor people are good.

TITANIC (DIDIER BECU),Didier-Becu,28 October 2003,"I used to be one of those who absolutely were not interested in seeing the movie but as it was on telly I decided to watch anyway...and look how wrong I am, I even gave it 4 stars.... Now the story itself is one without surprises as after all it's about a boat that hit an iceberg and I knew before that it's the kind of movie at where housewives are searching for handkerchiefs but the truth is that James Cameron (the Terminatorman) has used all Hollywoodcliches in the best way that can be used... The special effects are enormous and the interaction between Leonardo and Kate is one of a rare breed (and no I am not a Leonardo-fan at all...). Perhaps the whole thing was a bit too commercialised (but so was ""Gone with the wind"") and it's not the best movie ever and even 11 Oscars was a bit too much but absolutely worth 4 hours of your life.",8/10
what's the big deal?,dick_james,5 August 2010,"I watched this movie under the influence that it would be good. I don't get it. Is this supposed to be entertaining? The plot was totally pointless. Here's what happens: Some kid goes to a boat and finds this dog and then his stepfather says he can't keep it. Then there is a bear, and it's after the stepfather, but the dog comes to save him. Then it gets rabies and the boy freezes to death. How did that happen? I though this was about a boat? There was only one in the beginning.

That sort of explains why instead of credits I just got shoved by the usher and told to leave the theatre. Oh well, it was a long time ago.",1/10
"The Ship of Dreams, right back where it belongs . . .",The_Film_Cricket,7 April 2012,"Ever since Titanic left theaters, I avoided it. Watching it on television doesn't work. This is a film of such magnitude, that anything smaller than a theater screen degrades its vision. Now, the film is right back where it belongs, in theaters in an effort to jump (unnecessarily) on the 3D bandwagon. I can grouse about that, but just having the film in theaters is good enough for me. There is just no better venue for the ship of dreams.Titanic does what great movies do; creating a sense of time and place. Cameron takes an event that we know about and brings it close enough for us to understand. As a storyteller. he understands that our minds are likely to get lost in the chaos of the sinking so his remedy is to stage a computer simulation at the beginning of the film (in present day) that explains exactly how the ship was damaged. By the time we get to the disaster, we're oriented. In that way, we can focus on the human element.To get to the Titanic, Cameron gives us a modern foothold, framing the film with an expedition to the ship still sitting at the bottom of the Atlantic, forever halted in its maiden voyage to America. The expedition is led by Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton), whose interest in Titanic is procuring a 17th century diamond that belonged to Louis XIV. Nothing turns up, but what he does find leads him to a 100 year-old woman named Rose (Gloria Stuart) one of the last living survivors.The story that she lays out is a reminder that Titanic wasn't just a curiosity, but a reality for those who were there. Rose's story, of how she sailed home to an arranged marriage set up by her destitute mother, is a window into the painful struggle of being a young woman in the early 20th century. For Rose, she is sailing home to a life of marital imprisonment. Initially describing the ship as ""The Ship of Dreams"", she laments that ""It was the ship of dreams to everyone else. To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in chains."" We see the young Rose so depressed that she considers suicide. She is saved by Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a traveler who made his way onto the ship through a poker game. Jack is everything she wishes to be. He opens Rose's mind to what life has to offer. They develop a deep passion that builds. Ironically, it is at the moment that their passion reaches its peak that the tragedy strikes. With that, we understand their motivations as they try and save each other as the ship goes down. The actors have such a lovely chemistry together that we want them to be together. Rose's fire and spirit are still there even as she crossed the century mark in age.The best performance in the film comes from Gloria Stuart as the elder Rose. Stuart was a veteran of the golden age of Hollywood, 84 when Titanic was made, and 100 when she died two years ago - plus, she was 2 years-old when the Titanic sank. Stuart plays Rose, a centenarian who becomes the modern link with the tragic events of that night. It is in her eye-witness testimony that Titanic's tragic story is brought to life. Her eyes are those that have borne witness to history. Her soft, ancient voice humanizes the story.If the human elements bring us closer to the characters, Cameron's special effects team does a masterful job of bringing the disaster to life. The tension of the last hour of the film is as agonizing for us as it must have been for those involved. The passengers slowly begin to realize what is happening and only come to the full realization when it is too late. Cameron's staging of the event is a master craft of special effects but also of pacing and tension. We know early on that the ship doesn't have enough lifeboats for all of the passengers (it had a smoking room, a swimming pool and a squash court, but not have enough lifeboats) and that makes the calamity all the more senseless.As I said, Titanic puts us front-row to this tragedy. We stand back and look at it clearly from a 21st century perspective and understand time and place. Even when the architect Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber) lays out the inevitability that the ship is doomed, Ismay is aghast ""But this ship can't sink!"" The architect is clear: ""She's made of iron, sir! I assure you, she can, and she will. It is a mathematical certainty."" Ismay's thinking represents the view of the times. Titanic was a marvel of the early 20th century industrial age, a ship so glorious that it was mistakenly thought to have been unsinkable. The tragedy was a grim reminder of the dark decade to come. Within two years, the same industrial might that built the ship would be used to build machines that fueled the slaughter of the WWI. In that way, Titanic's sinking represents the end of the 19th century, and the WWI represents the beginning of the 20th.But that's history. Let's get back to the movie. Revisiting Titanic is to find that it is a view of history seen through the vision of a cinema artist at the top of his craft. That craft hasn't aged one bit, but now it comes with 3D. As with all 3D presentations, the picture is dark and the images are often not in 3D. There were times when I forgot my 3D glasses, except for a few occasions where I could see the depth of the 3D image. That happened maybe six times in a three hour picture. That's not worth the up-charge, but I will say that the experience of seeing the film again in a theater is worth the inconvenience.",No Rating

sometimes the illusion of a good movie is all that counts,PatrynXX,7 September 1998,"First I'm gonna admit that for 4 months I was ranting about this movie from ocean to ocean.  Telling people that if you want to see a ship movie that is worth it, go see Das Boot.  Well April 19th I finally went to see the movie.  I went in thinking maybe 2 1/2 -3 star and came out emotionally spent.  I'm a guy and when a movie hits you that hard, I end up liking the movie so much.  What really made this movie worked was James Horner's score.  Only he could have done it.  I'm not one of those obsessed people who decided to see the movie 90 times (couldn't afford that even if I wanted to), I don't go out and buy the calendars, puzzles, shirts, diamonds related to the movie.  I do like reading about Titanic's history.  I like to take photographs, seeing old photographs makes the feeling the more real.   Contrary to many people, I think Kate Winslet is the star of the show and not Leo.  He's almost a non issue except that if not because of Leo, Kate would be wandering about God only know where or dead already. I hope Kate Winslet gets some movies worth her talent.  I know Leo's Man behind the Iron Mask was less than expected. So he's not perfect either. When I watch a movie I try very hard not to think about the politics of a movie.  Want a good way to ruin a movie, that's a good way how.  It's hard to believe that someone who completely hated the movie decided to see it.

A stunning example of the idiocy of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.,Lisy-2,7 August 1999,"When I saw ""Titanic,"" I thought it was vaguely entertaining, and the costumes and special effects were beautiful. However, I didn't leave the theatre discussing it with my friends, and I didn't feel or think any differently than three and a half hours earlier. Then I heard it had been nominated for numerous Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and I was outraged.Not surprisingly, this big-budget piece of recycled Hollywood trash won, even against three of its wonderful competitors, ""L.A. Confidential,"" ""As Good as it Gets,"" and ""Good Will Hunting."" The first has plenty of interesting plot twists and amazing performances, the second gives a fresh and cynically humorous look at romance, and the third helped ME realize some things about myself, at least.  ""Titanic"" did nothing like that.The screenplay was something that had been done dozens and dozens of times before, and as far back as the Elizabethan era, as the ludicrous, 'Romeo & Juliet'-esque romance will prove. The performances, even by such normally-wonderful actors as Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, and Kate Winslet were either dry, or over-done. I imagine that if one had to 'listen' to this movie  rather than have the dialogue and music (which is pretty at parts, but just a repeat of many of Horner's other scores) accompany the pretty images, it would be completely unbearable.",1/10
"Named Titanic, but turns out to be an oversized Love Boat.",The Wick,2 June 1999,"A fictional romantic story rapping itself up in a true tragedy.Cameron goes to all the work on the detail of the set and overlooks the time period.

If one is going to do a period piece, then one should research the period.The true story of the Titanic would have been a better movie.

A young aspiring painter meets a high class rich girl on the deck of Titanic and falls in love with her. Unfortunately , their love story is short lived as they face off the ill-fated disaster when their ship struck the iceberg and slowly sinks in the sea.

I just came back after watching the 3D version of the film and I felt that I've seen the flick for the first time even though I've seen it 14 years back when it broke all the records in domestic as well in international circuits. I have always been an immense admirer for Cameron's work right from Terminator series till the visually enthralling Avatar. He not only gives his best shot but also works on the minute details to make his film a must watch. Similarly , he directed Titanic and gives a detailed level explanation of what really happened on the tragic night of 14th April , 1914. The screenplay and writing should be given full marks. The cinematography and art direction are grandeur giving a feeling of living Titanic through 194 mins. Background score by James Horner is so intriguing that it gels well with the mood of the film. Performances by Leanardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet is worth mentioning. They were young and relatively new when they did the film but I must tell you , they were superb.

Meh,ethanhatcher,16 December 2016,"I enjoyed watching this film. The visuals were good and the depiction of the sinking itself is good. But throughout, the film, and especially through the cheesy romance scenes, I couldn't help but think, ""there were 2200 people aboard the ship. Shouldn't at least ONE of them have a movie worthy story? It was a tragic night/morning, so why would Mr Cameron need to make a fake story when he could find an actual survivors story."" A thing it did right was the humanization of the disaster. When they focused on a non jack/rose character, I.e a real person like Captian Smith or Andrews or the Strausses and especially the band, the result was great. I don't consider myself a manly man, but normally I don't show much sadness for movies. However, I teared up a couple of times during the film (not during jacks death). The parts I'm talking about are the ""Nearer My God, To Thee"" scene and rose's heaven. But there is a very good reason DiCaprio didn't win an Oscar for this. HE AND WINSELT'S ACTING WAS BAD! It was just plain wooden at best. And don't get me started on jack didn't have to die. I agree. Yes the panel (ITS NOT A DOOR) could of held both of them, but only after they put the life preserver under the panel to improve buoyancy. But I'm going further back than that. ROSE WAS ON A FKING LIFEBOAT! THERE WOULD BE 1500 PEOPLE ONBOARD WHO WOULD KILL FOR A LIFEBOAT SPOT! AND SHE HOPS BACK ON THE BLOODY SHIP! WHAT DOES JACK SAY RIGHT AFTER!? ""You're so stupid Rose!""

I didn't think that any film that put fictional characters in a real setting, especially one as dramatic as the Titanic disaster could succeed. I was wrong.""Titanic"" is an excellent film in all respects. Both DiCaprio and Winslet have a realistic and charismatic chemistry with each other. Kathy Bates was born to play the role of Molly Brown, Billy Zane is wonderfully despicable as the intended husband for Winslet, and Bernard Hill lends a great deal of respect to his role as Captain John Smith.But the real star is indeed, the ship itself.

The grand staircase with the carving of hope and glory crowning time, the staterooms, the ballroom, the smoking lounges, all replicated with incredible attention to detail.The details surrounding the sinking were incredible as well. I believe this is the first motion picture to address the fact that the ship split in half as it sank, instead of going down whole. The entire sinking sequence is incredibly chilling and you will not be able to turn your eyes away from it.If you are one of the few that have not yet seen Titanic, watch it soon, and see if it doesn't amaze and move you.And by the way... if you find yourself in Orlando, FL, check out the Titanic exhibition. You won't be disappointed.",10/10
Complete and utter trash,dx2-2,24 September 2005,"Now firstly, I was impressed at the effort put into this film... HOWEVER, after seeing it, I have come to this conclusion: This would be a great movie were it not for the lack of originality, what you see here is an ancient plot line marketed on the blood of people who died in this tragedy, if you want to see a similar film, get out Romeo and Juliet (another DiCaprio film) which contains exactly the same appalling rigid acting from young Leonardo and practically the same plot line! Boy meets girl, girl already engaged or to be engaged with a fatal divide, in R+J it's the family divide (Montigues and Capulets), in titanic it is the barrier between the rich and the poor, the only reason this desecration of Shakespeares work (Romeo and Juliet + Boat) sold is because it had special effects involving the sinking of the liner 'The Titanic', THAT was it's USP, what else is there? The story? Already covered that. The acting? Hell no. A girl in one of my classes at college was praising the writer on such an imaginative story: "" How did he come up with the idea of creating this story of a large ship sinking AND adding love."" Now don't get me wrong, I wouldn't base this review on one silly girls remark, but if you reverse that, there was no creativity in it, the only creativity involved was part of the tarnishing of the past of REAL people who were on the boat, the man who shot himself for killing a passenger, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN! He gave his life to save others... Where is the conscience of the Hollywood pigs who tainted this guys past? The best part of this film was the end, and I love this film solely for the sweet consolation of the absolute poorness of this film that is the drawn out death of the character that is Jack Dawson.",1/10
This movie is FAR better than the imdb rating!,jjh6519,8 October 2002,"Previously, I wrote that I loved ""Titanic"", cried at its ending (many times over), and I'm a guy in his 60's.  I also wondered about why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users.Well, I looked at the breakdown of the user ratings.  While 29.0% of all votes gave it a 10 rating, 10.7% gave it a 1 rating.  These 10.7% of these irrational imdb users, in effect, pulled the overall rating down to 7.0.  
In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting pattern (a sudden surge in 1 ratings, with a high 10 rating, dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level) on only one thing: hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio.  Believe me, I've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people (young men, mostly), who defame him left and right.  They absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in giving him any credit in ""Titanic"".  (To answer one other user:  I am NOT talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc.  Everyone has, and is entitled to, his/her own taste.  But no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for ""Titanic"", pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.)Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of ""Titanic"" to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical ""bombs"" (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point).  ""Heaven's Gate"" (1980) was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing, and imdb voters' ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall rating of 6.1).  ""Big Top Pee-wee"" (1988) got 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating of 4.5).  ""Cat People"" (1982) got 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8).   ""Blind Date"" (1987) got 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3).  ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" (1986) got 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2).  WHAT DO ALL OF THESE FILMS HAVE IN COMMON WITH ""TITANIC""?  ALL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER !!!! THAN ""TITANIC"", AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS EVER WAS NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE AWARD.  Again, ""Titanic"" got 10.7% 1 ratings!  Compare that to the other 5 movies I just mentioned.Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factor?",10/10
Lame,BennYJr,25 March 2003,"This movie is kind of lame. I'l write here some of the biggest mistakes of the movies:Why oh why is one of the people getting on the life boats wearing a digital watch? Surely they weren't around in 1912? -Young Rose has green eyes, but Old Rose has blue eyes. Later in the film, there is a fade between the faces of young & old Rose and this time old Rose's have magically changed to match Kate Winslet's eyes-After Rose has helped Jack to get loose from where he is handcuffed, as he is jumping over a bench one minute he has the handcuffs on, the next shot they're gone. Then they're back. -After Rose breaks Jack's handcuffs below decks and both race down the hallways outrunning the rising water. Rose is clearly wearing white sneakers yet she is seen 30 seconds later wearing period shoes when Jack retrieves the gate key that the crewman dropped beneath the rising water.There are too many of them, so I'l stop here!

Not Believable,cncgjqbm,4 August 2021,"The storyline was brilliant and enjoyable with brilliant directing. The film made you care about the characters and their death. The audience knew the ship was going to sink, but leading up to the ship sinking made you care about the people and crew. This film was about building on the characters. Kate Winslet stole the film.However, Leonardo with Kate Winslet made this film unbelievable and annoying. It's hard to imagine Kate with the homeless and unattractive Leonardo. Kate definitely deserved to be recognized for her performance and Leonardo should have never been mentioned. In reality Kate's character would have never been with the unattractive and homeless Leonardo over Billy's character of a millionaire. Billy is so much more attractive and successful than Leonardo who is such a boy.Leonardo was a cry baby when he wasn't nominated for an Oscar and Kate was. Kate gave a remarkable performance and nothing stood out with Leonardo.",7/10
A sinking feeling.,Pjtaylor-96-138044,21 May 2020,"'Titanic (1997)' is bogged down by arguably unnecessary modern day sequences, its run-time sailing well beyond the time it actually took for its eponymous ship to sink. These opening and closing moments are what started Cameron's seemingly unending obsession with deep-sea documentation and, in some ways, seem a little too indulgent. However, they do add a layer of theming to the thing and sort of explain the director's motives in making a massively budgeted, romantically focused epic out of one of the most well-known tragedies of the twentieth century. Once the piece progresses into its bulk, it starts to become a lot more interesting. The film revels in its splendid set-design and CG-enhanced environments, marvelling at its own ability to aptly convey the period and paying immense attention to even the smallest of details (though it's apparently content with 'filling in the gaps' any way it pleases). At times, the picture feels rather self-congratulatory, to be honest. However, this confidence is mostly well-placed; the movie did, after all, make over a billion dollars. Just because it made money doesn't mean it's automatically good, though. It's undeniably messy and slow, somewhat confused as to whether it wants to be a straight-forward historical tragedy or an alternate-history 'against all odds' romance (and that's not even mentioning the reflexive, somewhat self-aware vibes of the modern day stuff). Having said that, it's effective on more than one occasion. Some of the romantic banter between its leads is charming, as is their overall relationship, and the 'clash of the classes' angle is generic but enjoyable. Any time DiCaprio and Winslet share the screen, the film is fairly entertaining. However, it doesn't get properly gripping until the DVD asks you to change disks halfway through. This latter half is dedicated, almost entirely, to the sinking of the ship. This is a well-known fact and, frankly, a key selling point of the picture, so it isn't exactly a surprise. Yet, the extended sequence does a good job of maintaining tension by introducing mini conflicts which don't have a pre-determined end. This segment contains some visually spectacular stuff, as water floods corridors or crushes characters against gates and the whole ship turns on its side as it sinks to the depths below. Thankfully, this stuff isn't beautiful; it's devastating. Some of it is really suspenseful, too. It's the most successful aspect of the piece, for sure - although it does feature a shot that demonstrates literally the worst 'face replacement' I've ever seen. When it comes down to it, the flick isn't as impactful as it should have been. It struggles to balance its two major elements, feels unnecessarily long and is often somewhat self-indulgent (and, thus, rather dull). It is, however, a visually spectacular and occasionally charming experience with a highly effective final third. It's long and uneven, but it's probably worth a go if you're a fan of DiCaprio, Winslet, Cameron or, somewhat strangely, historical tragedies. 6/10",6/10
Had potential but blew it.,DylanMcChillin,18 July 2018,The movie is so historically inaccurate that it should be considered a satire. It's extremely disappointing and the acting is subpar. Hopefully they'll do a remake of an actual story that occurred on the Titanic.,No Rating

because the plot is amazing and it's a true story .It was really,really sad at the end . But I think that the way Jack died is stupid because there was enough place on the floating wood piece for two persons .The cast was very good with Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet .The specials effects when the boat hit the iceberg or when the boat
get broken were awesome .But I didn't really like the romance part at the beginning of the movie .It's an old movie,it was released on the seventh January 1998 but the specials effects are still good today.",9/10
The classic sample of cinematic junk with pretty wrapping...,herodyssey,28 August 2000,"I must be the only person I know that does not gush when the title ""Titanic"" is mentioned.  I sat through the whole movie wondering if I'd have been better off staying home and doing laundry, and I've come to the conclusion, that yes, I probably would have been.This movie is recycled cr*p.  They took the classic ""Rich girl loves poor boy"" story, tagged on one of the world's largest tragic events, stuck in a pretty face or two (forget about acting ability -- Kate dear, you were better in Sense and Sensibility), ten bazillion dollars for a budget and bingo, you've got yourself a blockbuster that attracts hoards of lip glossed, hip huggered, chunky heeled, Britney Spears listening, glitter wearing teenaged girls.  All for the sake of a pre-pubescent Leonardo DiCaprio (c'mon! He looks like he's twelve). It saddens me that something as shallow as a teen heart throb can elevate a piece of junk like Titanic to what some call the best movie of all time. Argh!The only part of this movie that actually made me stop and look were the beautiful CGI effects. However prettiness and expensive effects doth not a good movie make.  Other than that, spitting off a ship and contrived chases with guns do not appeal to me much as good cinema.  I'd recommend everyone to see it at least once, but not for the sake of seeing a good movie, but to remind society that we're too used to being served 2 for $1 cans of tuna that were prepared for the cost of caviar. It's still just tuna.",1/10
An All-time Classic! An Epic Disaster movie...,akash_sebastian,9 April 2012,"This James Cameron's ambitious venture is a cinematic masterpiece which is easily the most meticulously rendered and relentless disaster movie ever made.Though it has various clich√©s and flaws, and may deviate from what actually happened that night, people should remember this it's not a historic or biographic movie; it's a fictional epic love story with the historic setting of the sinking of the Titanic. Some may say, the two main characters so easily & neatly fall in love in such a short period of time or that the division between the social classes is exaggerated... But the amazing acting by the long list of talented actors, James Cameron's brilliant direction, Russell Carpenter's elegant cinematography and production designer Peter Lamont's intricate recreation of the ship truly bring the story to life, help us overlook the minor shortcomings and makes us all fall in love with it.*** SPOILERS ***Over the years, it's effect on me might have changed. Earlier, it was the disaster and the deaths which affected me. Now, the various characters and their journeys just make me think... - Rose, who was bored of meaningless aristocratic life, finds a purpose and new meaning when she meets Jack. With his help, she finally gets the courage to cut her ties from that high-society world. Even after Jack dies, she keeps her promise and explores other fields, becomes an actress, marries, and goes on to live for over 80 years. - Jack, who has been to many places studying people and drawing them, meets a complex rich girl and falls for her. - Cal Hockley, who is used having whatever he sets his eyes upon, couldn't bare it when he realizes that his fianc√©e, Rose, is slowly slipping through his hands. In the end, he becomes so frustrated that he even starts shooting at them. - There are so many other such interesting characters, from the architect who feels guilty that he wasn't able to design a strong ship and decides to die along with it, the captain who after 26 years of experience feels remorse for not taking his last voyage's ship safely to shore, to the crew member who shoots two people for creating a chaos and finally killing himself not able to bear what he had just done.*** END of SPOILERS ***And who can forget the last one hour of the film involving the sinking? It has been shot and executed quite brilliantly.Unfortunately, people love to comment negatively about something good, because they are unable to think for themselves and have a need to be accepted in their 'clique'. Many people who loved the movie at one time or another now talk derogatorily about it thinking that it would make them seem cool. FYI, talking crap about a movie like 'Titanic' doesn't make you look cool. It tells a lot about the person or his/her taste in movies.",9/10

James Cameron's Titanic is still entertaining with 3-D adding a little to the experience,tavm,29 April 2012,"Well, 15 years after first seeing this at a second run-dollar theatre that I worked at when I was living in Jacksonville, FL, I finally decided to watch Titanic again in 3-D at the place my movie cinema-working friend is now employed at. Once again, we experienced the romance between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as the latter wants to escape the more controlling Billy Zane. Despite the dialogue between them verging on the melodramatic, director James Cameron also thought up some truly witty lines that especially suited Kathy Bates as the Unsinkable Molly Brown. And, yes, it's still very touching seeing Jack and Rose willing to stay together during all that chaos as the title ship keeps sinking. And how cool is it seeing Golden Age veteran Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose recounting how it was during Titanic's only voyage. And not to mention James Horner's iconic score. And while I thought Celine Dion's Oscar-winning song ""My Heart Will Go On"" was overplayed on Top 40 radio stations then, I actually enjoyed hearing it again during the end credits (though we only stayed through the cast list). And of course, Cameron keeps things exciting enough during the climatic sinking though sometimes I thought he piled it a bit much when he showed a young boy crying just standing there as Jack and Rose were running (it felt a little more contrived than usual though I realized such a scene could have really taken place). In summation, James Cameron's Titanic is still a very entertaining picture worthy of its Oscar status enhanced a bit by the 3-D experience though it wasn't really necessary IMHO.",9/10
"Contrived, and in many ways, offensive",SnobbyDude,15 January 2003,"Truth is stranger (and more interesting) than fiction, and this movie proves it.  Aspiring comedians that take courses on perfecting their art are always told that their real life is a much more interesting place to start than the imagination when writing material.  Why?  Truth is often more interesting than anything that you can come up with on your own.  I think this is the reason why this movie is so contrived and phony.  Rich girl, poor boy, snobby/evil/shallow rich people, noble/happy poor people...can you get any less original?  The stereotypes are offensive as well.  All the Irish people are drinking, partying, poor people, and the rich are all cold-hearted wasps.  Then there is the dialog.  I was cringing at every line and actually felt bad for the actors because they had such awful lines to work with. When I first saw this movie, I thought the lines sounded so bad, in part, because of some poor acting.  Since then, I have seen other movies with Leo in them and can see that he is a good actor, but just had some awful material to work with in Titanic.I wish that the creators of this film used the real story of the titanic as a source of their inspiration.  Instead, the main focus of the movie isn't the titanic or all the real people that lost their lives in this tragedy. The movie is really mostly about a fake love story that reaches new heights of cheesyness.  I think making a movie about two fake people (two fake annoying people) named Jack and Rose makes light of a very real event where many real people died.  I bet every single one of those real people had a more interesting life than Jack and Rose.The movie does, however, have one good thing going for it.  It does have good special effects.  This saves it from getting the lowest possible score. I gave it 2/10",2/10
The most overrated movie of all time,Verbal-17,30 March 1999,"Before anything, let me say that this was a very good movie: the special effects were incredible, and the final hour was spellbindingly powerful. And if the entire movie had been about this, had been about the Titanic itself, then I would have loved it. However, it wasn't. Instead, it supplies us with two and a half hours of a boring, predictable, badly written and badly acted romance that is no different than any other movie romance that has been seen in the past 10 years. Let's see: a pretty girl is engaged to a rich snob because of pressure from her parents, and then a young drifter (who looks suspiciously like a 25 year-old model) ""rescues"" her, and they fall in love. Gee, no cliches so far. Some of the script was awful. For example, at the beginning, Rose says, ""You think you can save me?"" and Jack responds, ""No, only you can do that."" That's fine, except then at the end, old Rose tells her granddaughter, ""there was a man named Jack who saved me, in all the ways a person can be saved."" Which is a total contradiction to what Jack told her. And the worst line of the whole movie (or any movie I've seen in recent years): the ship is going down. Right in front of their eyes thousands of innocent men, women and children are dying. So what does Rose do? She looks at Jack, smiles, and says, ""Look honey, this is where we first met!"" How dramatic! I wanted to puke. I realize that I'm nitpicking here, but my point is, if you're going to make a drama about such an important event, why give us two hours of watching Kate Winslet spit over the edge of a ship and other such things? I've met some morons say that they consider this to be the ""greatest movie ever made."" Say WHAT?! Better than Star Wars? Better than The Godfather? Better than Casablanca? Better than Schindler's List?! Get a grip, people- it's a good movie, but you're blowing it way out of proportion.",No Rating
This is Hollywood at it's top,revival05,17 May 2000,"I'm not really sure why so many people hated this movie, but I've got a few theories:1. Leonardo DiCaprio (I can agree, but he wasn't that bad)2. Jealousy against Leonardo DiCapro (Guys, c'mon, admit it)3. It was a drama (some teenager probably hated it just because it was a lovestory, I know a few)4. They don't want to get swallowed by the hype5. They're against Hollywood6. They can't stand too long moviesOr maybe it's the classic one: They hate it, just because everybody else did it.Well, here's my comment (and I am a guy, and I'm not fag):Finally a big bang here from Hollywood. A 3 hour epic with remarkable special effects. Another example is BEN-HUR, hey same amount of Oscars!!Well now. I first saw this movie, when it came and I was amazed! I mean, wow! It was entertaining, thrilling and even though you knew the plot and storyline (the ship will sink, hope THATS not a spoiler) you were kept at your seat, because you didn't want to miss a thing, and you just had to find out what was going to happen. And what about this crankiness against the script. It is a classic setup. Three acts (the story actually stops at about every hour so I'm not that out of here) , the beginning with the proud ship and the glorious ''first class' and some character-presentations, the middle where the ship hits the ice and the worrying starts while some characters gets developed, and the final act wich is an hour of thrilling action and glorious special effects! I have NEVER IN MY LIFE witness such a simple but so genius storyline! And I can't understand those who wasn't impressed.OK, the acting might not be as great as it maybe should. DiCaprio is the obvious choose to get money, but he's not the right kid, and the worst part is HE FIT'S IN (might sound a bit strange). Winslet was good, but BILLY ZANE was the best! I just loved that character. I ''almost'' laughed in every scene in he was in. James Cameron here shows that he can make any genre (but the action is his top), and of course Bill Paxton hangs along too.This might not be THE BEST movie ever made, but it is definitively one of my semi-finalists! 9/10",8/10
"Overrated...good, but overrated",Estella,19 April 1999,"No way is this the greatest film of all time. Not by a long shot. To compare this to GONE WITH THE WIND and Leo and Kate's performances to that of Viven Leigh and Clark Gable is ridiculous. Though Titanic IS good, it is no film of all time. Leo and Kate, though excellent in their performances are no Gable and Leigh, and though the film may be an epic, the ludicrous amount of Oscars slapped onto it (SO predictably) makes it less enjoyable because of the tons of hype lavished on it. Gone With The Wind was made at a time when films won Oscars for being GOOD. Today it depends on what film has the most budget and hype! Titanic: GWTW of the 90's? I think not.",No Rating

Bad movie only saved by one actor,tuckhead,8 June 2019,"A sappy movie about a petty criminal who falls in love with a murderous, thieving rich girl on a poorly designed ship. The story is predictable and boring, the soundtrack is equivalent to a million fingernails on a million chalkboards. The only redeeming thing about this film is the amazing performance by the master, Billy Zane. Once again Mr. Zane shows off his prodigious acting abilities and turns a rather bland movie into a master piece. Leonardo DiCaprio should have paid closer attention to him and maybe he would have learned something.

A Modern Masterpiece,madshell,22 August 2000,"In James Cameron's finest film to date, he writes and directs a period piece worthy of its name, and a solemn homage to those who passed on that fateful night in 1912.

What hell must be like,jerome_w,28 September 1998,"My job requires me to travel every week to some other part of the country and I usually come home on the weekends. This summer I traveled from Washington to California every week. So twice a week I was on a 5 hour flight. I will not mention the airline, but they decided to capitalize on Titanic's popularity and show it as many times as they could. Well, guess what. I ended up having to sit through Titanic a total of 6 times!!! This must be what hell is like. I had to sit through a movie 6 times more than I wanted to see it. I saw it at the movies (friends payed for the ticket because I wouldn't see it otherwise) and I thought to myself what a crappy movie. But after being subjected to a whole month of Cameron and Leo I hate this movie more than anything else in existence. You see, the flights I'm on either have One big screen for the whole cabin or strategicaly placed monitors. So even if you don't ""RENT"" the headset you still have to be subjected to the visual ""majesty"" of Titanic.

I like romantic movies, don't get me wrong, but this is too cheesy and simple, which love invariably isn't. In it's defence though, I would like to comment on the fact that the special effects department did a splendid job, but unfortunately I like my films to have a good and varied plot which this film totally lacks. The Titanic was a great ship, ahead of it's time and was a icon of it's time, which makes this film an absolute travesty as it doesn't do Titanic's memory any justice.",5/10
My Heart Still Goes On - More So In 3D,sarahmillyhannah,27 April 2012,"I was looking through these reviews last week contemplating whether or not I should see this movie again upon its 100 year anniversary 3D release. I was looking to see if anyone had reviewed yet, more on the film's re release in its 3D glory - sadly they hadn't so I though if i want to know if its worth the price tag I will have to go. Considering myself to be interested in the titanic - not enough to call myself a Titanorack mind - I have learnt a lot about that ship, whether it be on the t.v or in books. Curiosity got the better of me and I decided to don on the 3D glasses required and watch the movie. James Cameron is the king of 3D. 3D to me being pretty much a gimmick which i think only works with made for 3D films on the big screen only. Avatar is the perfect example of this. Although i didn't care for the film much the 3D is sensational. Made for 3D movies such as Avatar and Piranha etc I have enjoyed and found them effective. You can see a lot of effort has gone into the 3D for Titanic. Some of the scenes are magnificent. The lifeboats rowing away being the best 3D scene for me in the film. Was that worth the price of the ticket? I am very undecided. I love this film and have seen it numerous times and I am not sure 3D added anything extra to the film because it wasn't made for 3D it didn't have the same effect for me. I think for me it was a chance again to see the film of the big screen which I enjoyed again very much. One thing I did think about on seeing it in 3D yesterday was why on earth was Billy Zane in this film? He is more hammy than William Shatner in Star Trek and not in a good way. But where this film is concerned my heart will always go on ..so if you want to know if its worth going to see in 3D I would say if you are a massive fan or never seen it before yes, otherwise not..",10/10
A Sad and Touching Drama.,movies2u,20 November 2001,"I have seen Titanic about a million times, and I have to say that the movie is a very entertaining and sad drama film. James Cameron did a wonderful job in being a director, and the acting was great. I give Titanic a 10 out of 10.  :)",No Rating

"Pathetic, high-budget, glorified version of Love Boat",Chessack,11 October 2000,"As normal, I break with most people I know, since they generally loved this movie. I didn't like it at all, for a large number of reasons.First of all, it was too long. They showed detail in scenes that did not need detail, and even within the movie, they re-hashed scenes multiple times. In fact, it almost felt like the second half of the movie was a poorly-done sequel to the first half of the movie. In the first half, we saw way too much detail about the 'daily life' on the ship, most of which I found boring and not worthy of my time to watch.  In the second half, we saw a 90 minute pseudo-documentary of the sinking of the Titanic, an event which even in real life only took 2 hours. So basically, James Cameron showed us almost every single minute of the sinking. This is poor from a technical dramatic standpoint. Good drama glosses over the boring, nitty-gritty details, to focus on the important stuff. Cameron decided to show the nitty-gritty details with as much care and attention as the important sequences. Some interpret this as ""great attention to detail."" I don't see it that way. I see it as boring depiction of events that are neither relevant to the plot nor worthy of my time to witness.This brings us to my second complaint about this movie: the plot. Basically, this was a glorified, very expensive version of the old TV show ""The Love Boat."" Indeed, most episodes of ""Love Boat"" that I can recall were of a higher caliber, plot-wise and dialog-wise, than this movie was. I thought the dialog was forced, and stale, and did not ""ring true"" at all. Cameron was too ""present"" in the movie -- that is, I felt that he was forcing the characters to do exactly what he wanted, rather than having events take their ""natural"" course. Probably, this is because he was depicting something based in truth (the sinking of the Titanic), and so he had no choice about where the overall story would end up (the ship sinks -- I assume this is not a spoiler for anyone, heh heh). Thus, he had to force the part of the story that leads up to the sinking in a certain direction, and he did this in a poor manner that was too blatant, and made the whole thing seem artificial.I also thought both the principle actors (Kate Winslett, Leo DiCaprio) turned in terrible performances. I didn't really believe in either of them. Worse yet, they annoyed me, and their characters really irritated me. This is a terrible flaw in a disaster movie: if you dislike the characters to which the disaster (in this case, the sinking of the ship) is going to happen, then you really don't care whether they live or die. In fact, I was actually rooting for BOTH of them to die, because by the end of the film, they had irritated me enough that it was the only way I thought I'd get any satisfaction.I will admit that the film had excellent special effects. Normally, I like special effects movies. I even don't mind ones that openly, honestly have no interest in plot, characters, or story. However, Titanic had none of those things except special effects, but tried to pretend like it did. It's that presumptuousness that really irritated me. The movie so blatantly lavish, scenes were so clearly done ""just to show they could do it,"" that I could sense the arrogance of Cameron and the entire cast and crew in every scene.
This movie was a big waste of more than 3 hours of my time. My rating: 1/10.",1/10
In the Middle,zapdude,2 March 2003,"I managed to avoid watching this movie for years. I'm surprised that its rating here on IMDB is 7.0Considering the rabid fan base, and the fact that you could NOT escape that horrid theme song for forever, I would have thought it was an awesome movie.When push comes to shove, it's an OK movie, but it's neither AWESOME nor TERRIBLE.In short, it is a 7.0 movie, I guess.The first half is the best, the second half falls apart completely. I guess it just goes to show that the more money you pour into a project, the more you can get out.",7/10
Perfect 10. Magnificently!,saletehnolog,24 October 2017,"Titanic is one of the best movies I've been watching. Di Caprio and Kate are magnificent, producing and directing fascinating. The shiny scenes from the moment of impact in the ice floe to total submersion take away breath. When I remember those scenes when Kate takes the ax and enters the water to the head to reach the room where Leonardo is bound, an angry pass me. The complete set is enchanting. This is a movie that fully justified the funds invested and who for the reason earned a lot more money. Although the film was made in the late nineties, I can say that he is a classic for all time. Jamie Cameron set standards for the future with this film.",10/10
Good enough,alexsnower,12 July 2021,"As someone interested in titanic history, I like to see movies based on the event. However, I can't say this is the best movie in terms of acting, CGI or plot development. Kate Winslet whines her way to an average performance. I'm not sure why she was picked to be the lead female. DiCaprio does a good job but not his best work. Billy Zane is also weird casting choice and he isn't exactly great. The best actor/actress performance in the movie is probably Gloria Stewart. The CGI is not good, I know it was early in the game but some of it looks bad for 90's standards. I do like the movie being a wide stream outlet for knowledge on the titanic. However, the breaking of the ship is very inaccurate in the movie. The stern did not settle that high before the structural failure. Otherwise all the water sinking the ship looked nice. The grand staircase was particularly lovely. That scene alone makes this at least a 5.",7/10

How dare you call this film good?!,Issic,3 December 1998,"The main reason why I watched this was simple-I wanted to see how Hollywood can waste close on $300 million on a film. After leaving the cinema I thought they had wasted all this amount on some tripe, and I said to myself-what could they have done to help some poverty stricked country. The plot itself was one of the weakest of 1997, the leads were cardboard characters and the dialogue made me want to get up and slap them all crazy. The computer generated graphics were so obvious, esp. when they did overhead shots of the ship sailing through the ocean (polygon people anyone?). Still however there are always good sides to every bad thing, and the sinking of the ship was a feast for the eyes. It was almost like you were there! The details on the whole were very accurate and the costumes were gorgeous. The ending was very sad, and gave a human face to the tragedy, but it didn't erase the first three-quarters. It's an average film at best, and a Leo DiCaprio trailer/James Cameron ego satisfier, and DOES NOT deserve all the accolades it has gathered.",No Rating

Okay, I understand that people might have got caught up in the hysteria at the time but surely people can now see all the cliches and sentimentality.

My only wish for 'the most overrated movie of all-time' is .. would it sink!,Old Joe,2 August 2003,"SPOILER ALERT The first time I watched this film it was a highly emotional experience, the second time, ironically, it bored me to 'tears'. I realise that it was one of the biggest movies in cinema history, but after initially 'liking it', I could see through its grandness and see that it had big faults. The consensus of the 'general public' was that the 'titanic' is a great movie, however I am one person who disagrees.One of the world's greatest tragedies, Titanic, the 'unsinkable' ship, a most unimaginable human catastrophe. The untold stories lay in mystery two and a half miles beneath the waves of the North Atlantic. Now, in a 'fictional romantic tale', Jack and Rose meet aboard the ill-fated 'Titanic', but their love gives them hope and courage as their trip aboard Titanic becomes a struggle just to survive.James Cameron certainly had big visions when he accepted the directing role on 'Titanic'. I believe Cameron wanted the 'Titanic' to appeal to a certain audience, perhaps young couples who have just fallen in love, I do not know. But what I do know is that having the love story in this film was unrealistic and boring for that matter. However, I did like how the film showed the events leading up too the ships demise, and the demise itself, as these had great drama and were what I was expecting from Cameron in the director's chair.But the biggest fault in this movie came from its story, which was also written by Cameron. Firstly, I did not like how the story started, having it being told from the point of view of a much older Rose (Gloria Stewart). Instead, I would have rather the story start with all the excitement of seeing the Titanic about to leave the doc. Then to write in a love story, such as the one presented here, was a typical Hollywood move, very corny, and for me, unappreciated. I agree with the people who say that the love story presented here is most disrespectful to the people who lost their lives on board the ship. But would have such a relationship ever have developed on board Titanic? I say 'NO!', because the very experience of being on the Titanic would have been very overpowering for many people. Then again, when the story starts to show the ship in crisis that is when I became 'interested' again, as that I what I wanted to be told via the story.
I will admit that there was some pretty good acting talent on show in the 'Titanic'. Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is men that you could call plain lucky or unlucky, which ever way you look at his situation aboard the Titanic. Dawson is an artist, painting many different things. The only reason he is aboard the great ship, is because he won a hand of poker at the local saloon. He is now on the way to America. Little does he know what is about to unfold in his life. On the Titanic he casually glances at a beautiful woman, called Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). While DiCaprio and Winslet are great in their roles, I still find it hard to accept the love story the pair share, as I feel it was only ever there as a device to help sell the movie even more, however it did not work on me.There are other roles I enjoyed in Titanic. Rose's fianc√©, Caledon 'Cal' Hockley (Billy Zane), was great as the mean and nasty 'bastard.  He believes he can buy what he does not have, and gives Rose a necklace called 'the heart of the ocean', a big focal point to the film. I love when Cal gets angry and aggressive towards other people on the ship, especially Jack. How he escapes from drowning in the cold ocean waters, was very clever indeed. The other character I liked here was Margaret 'Molly' Brown (Kathy Bates). She is tagged as being 'unseekable Molly Brown', with many of the 1st class passengers not liking her at all. Bate's humour was a real highlight for me, as was her help for Jack, and her compassion for the drowning passengers of the Titanic.I also enjoyed the special effects of Titanic, showing the ship, both functioning and in demise, especially the moment where the ship tears itself in half, and start to sink. The sets are also done in a grand way in this film, showing how classy an experience it must have been on the Titanic. The musicals score to Titanic is not bad, as it makes for great drama, tension and emotion. The main song of the soundtrack, 'My heart will go on', sung by Celine Dion, was a big song at the time of this movie's release. However when I hear it these days, I cringe at how bad it really is.
Sure, the 'Titanic' is the highest grossing movie of all-time and winner of 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Director, but these facts do not change my opinion on how bad I think it is. I feel it is a movie that has suffered 'Hollywooditis', with just too much of the standard movie formula done here 'too sink a ship'. I would have preferred to see a much more low-key movie, focusing more on what it would like to be on such a ship as the 'Titanic', such as when Jack is at the front of the boat, screaming 'I'm the king of the world', as those sections of the movie had me captivated. I cannot say the same for its love story. Also, running at about 3 hours and 10 minutes, it was just a bit too long for my liking. I am amazed at how na√Øve the passengers were about the indestructibility of the Titanic, saying that it was 'unsinkable', because they were proven too be majorally wrong.CMRS gives 'Titanic': 1.5 (Bad - Ok Film)",No Rating
The name says it all,dnaeye,3 May 1999,"Anyone that says this ""movie"" is of any use to human existence is a consumer who has been brainwashed into conformity and an ethic of non-resistance and docility. When James Cameron self-proclaimed himself as the king of cinema, he effectively tied the noose around his neck. When people look upon this movie in ten years or so, they will realize with shame and embarrassment what complete fools the general public were to ever think this movie was anything besides big money.Some of the numerous bad points about this movie are as follows: special effects - made me think I was watching a computer game, therefore, not good (for a movie); acting - laughable, DiCaprio shows what a whining brat he can be; script - melodrama over a subject hardly reinvented, love between the lowly squire and rich princess?; directing - nothing extraordinary, actually, nothing UNordinary.But I suppose the masses have the final say with their wallets.

"The Second Worst ""Best Picture"" in History",jacksflicks,14 October 1999,"There is, in the Motion Picture Academy, a hidden criterion for awards. It's called the Miracle Factor.  If a huge, overblown spectacle film production manages to make a killing at the box office and isn't as bad a everyone thought it would be, it acknowledges this miracle with its Best Picture award.  This has happened at least twice:  in 1952, the malign, Red-baiting Cecil B. De Mille, bullied the corrupt, Red-baiting Academy into presenting him with an Oscar for the ridiculous circus spectacle, Greatest Show on Earth; then, in 1997, an equally corrupt, politically correct Academy presented Titanic with its Oscar.Titanic deserved an Oscar in only one category - special effects.  The story was trite, the acting mediocre (except Leo's, which didn't even get nominated), the editing OK (maybe deserving of an Oscar, since great special effects demand great editing).  Titanic's ""beating"" out L.A. Confidential is akin to Greatest Show on Earth's ""beating"" out High Noon.  Standing alone, Titanic is just another disaster spectacle.  But placed beside a film like L.A. Confidential, Titanic becomes pure garbage.This view is no better vindicated than by the Academy's choice for Best Picture the following year, Shakespeare in Love.  If Titanic got the ""Miracle it Wasn't That Bad"" Oscar, then Shakespeare in Love was given the ""Bad Conscience for Titanic"" Oscar. By the way, if you want to see a GOOD dramatization of the Titanic disaster, get A Night to Remember instead of this travesty.",6/10

Good movie but overrated!,Aleona,19 August 1999,"So much has been said about Titanic that it's hard to come up with anything new. Some people claim it's the greatest thing ever directed, others say one is too high of a rating. I fit in the middle. This movie had beautiful setting and scenery, some gorgeous shots of the ocean and the sunset. Three thumbs up to those who shot those scenes. And this movie DID have a plot, it didn't need to be three hours long, but non the less it was present. Titanic was a tragedy and this movie was not a celebration of it, it tried to put a story to it which it did. Although the characters were fictional, perhaps stories of the sort did happen (certainly not as dramatic though).Characters could of been a little more developed because with the exception of Sally Brown they were all black and white. I personally really liked the reactions of different people to what was happening on the ship. Nobility of the captain, mother's prayers, musicians attitude etc. Cameron very well portrayed those people.Something was missing from the plot however, it in a way lacked emotions. As I watching this movie, I realized that what was happening on that ship was awful, but I didn't get a sense of reality from it. I didn't feel the horror to the bones and I certainly didn't feel the pain of those people who were drowning. I mean, I knew it was there, I just didn't experience everything they did emotionally, and a good movie should make a person do that.I don't think this movie deserved an Oscar but it still deserved attention as a good movie with imperfections.

Powerful Film,oneflewovertheapocalypse,26 March 2004,"When looking back at Titanic you spot many faults with it and it doesn't seem as good as when you first watched it or you look back and think how cheesy a lot of the scenes were but at that first time you see it I think everybody who watched it was completely embraced into the life of Jack and Rose.  I was so excited seeing Titanic for the first time as it is The Gone With The Wind of our generation but with more special effects and more disaster like the Gone with the Wind was.   If you ask someone to this day what they think of titanic then you will probably get the response you might expect and that is it was rubbish or it didn't deserve the success that it got.   I think what annoyed a lot of people about Titanic was Leonardo Di Caprio because of the teen madness that surrounded the movie at the time, but that doesn't make it a bad film and it certainly doesn't make Leonardo's performance any less convincing than it was because he was top class and nothing more.   When I was going to see Gangs of new York I asked friends to come along but they didn't want to because of Di Caprio and if that is the reason why then they are without doubt narrow minded, it's not his fault that my friends girlfriends would rather sleep with him and not them but let's talk about the film.As soon as the film starts its pretty obvious how the ending is going to turn out but it's just not a story of Jack and Rose, it's about everybody that was aboard the Titanic.  These characters become more important obviously when the ship is sinking but it doesn't stop you caring and wondering about who these people were.   The scene where the young Irish mother is telling a poem to her children when they lay in their whilst the sea water over runs there deck just shows how cruel titanic was for sinking for letting that happen to people especially when there is nothing you can do about.  It reminded me of how somebody is drowning but is not actually underneath the water but is waiting to die , and I think that's what makes Titanic such an important movie about struggle and the strength to continue and fight for survival.  These are hidden messages but seem obvious once you have watched so many times like I have and James Cameron maybe a lot of things but a bad director he isn't as every film he has ever made apart from Piranha 2 have been masterpieces even True Lies can be seen as a comic action masterpiece as it has your villains, your hero's and the love interest.

Everyone's confused,Bram-5,7 February 1999,"Hold on a moment, Roger Ebert and everyone else who gave this movie a high rating.

The movie that made my face list to the right,David_Frames,9 May 2003,"Surely millions of people worldwide, a billion dollars and 11 Oscars can't be wrong can they? Well yes, actually.The problem with Titanic is that Cameron treats the whole enterprise like one of his action pictures, replete with the kind of staging you'd expect from that genre, but not alas, from a dramatisation of a genuine tragedy. Cameron has no faith in the emotional weight of the historical facts, and if we were being cynical we could also say no interest. This is an exercise in ego and directorial hubris from the outset, namely the idea that the writers fictional teenage romance - a story that never succeeds in rising above its clich√©d origins, is required to connect a contemporary audience to the events of 1912. You can see the logic because clearly the world's worst peacetime maritime tragedy, 1,500 dead and the planets most luxurious ocean liner sinking on its maiden voyage isn't an interesting enough story in itself. Subsequently the titular ship becomes merely a backdrop for a populist voyage into tedium. Just as you'd feel uneasy at the prospect of Michael Bay doing Jane Austen, Cameron doing period romance seems a little far fetched. Jack and Rose allow us to spend some time on the ship prior to its sinking and an impressive recreation it is but you'd quite like them to go away so we could see what the real passengers were up to. That he sustains momentum throughout this picture is despite his script, rather than because of it. His talent for pacing and moving a story forward serves him well in this respect but with fictional characters as one note as these, and with the ships real passengers reduced to supporting parts to bolster Cameron's mills and boon narrative, we, unlike the real passengers are quite grateful to see the Iceberg emerging from the watery depths.Once the ship hits the film moves up a gear and suddenly there is enough to sustain interest until the stilted syrup drenched epilogue. However, Cameron still stages the sinking like one giant set piece which saps the film of any emotional impact. A real tribute to the ship, rather than a cynical exercise in emotional manipulation would have taken an objective position and allowed the real events to unfold, giving us a chance to take in the full force of real events. This film concerns itself with fiction and doing so attempts to tell you what to feel and when to feel it. For me, this has the opposite effect and the scenes toward the end featuring Winslet and Decaprio are virtually unwatchable.The production design is superb and its all very epic and grandiose but ultimately Titanic is a disappointment because it takes a real tragedy and turns it into populist entertainment. History for people not interested in History. If you think thats a harsh assessment then imagine a similar scenario applied to a retelling of the September 11th attacks and think how inappropriate that would seem. These people may be 90 odd years dead but they deserve more respectful treatment than this. Watch ""A night to remember"" (1958) for a far better depiction of events which was informed by accounts of the sinking not by one man who thought he had something to 'add' to this terrible event. Avoid.",6/10
I was highly impressed,laurenbrigittepool,19 February 2014,"I have watched so many good movies. Some of the best of all time. But when I finished watching this movie I just wanted to watch it all over again. I have seriously never seen such an entertaining and good quality movie. I had watched parts of this movie a few years ago. Today I watched the whole thing for the first time in my life (I'm 15) and I cannot believe that someone could of produced a movie this good. The acting was so good I almost forgot that I was watching a movie. I cannot believe that someone had actually tried to make a second one because there is no way in hell it could beat this.Lets also face it, Leonardo was extremely enjoyable to look at. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. It doesn't matter what type of movies you like, I'm pretty sure Titanic covers all types of movies and you simply can't beat it. This is definitely my favourite movie now and I can't wait for tomorrow to start so I can watch it all over again after school tomorrow.",10/10
A Titanic masterpiece,MichaelOates,13 April 2004,"How does one describe the perfect film? In order to answer this question, one must watch the perfect film. In this case ""Titanic"" is the perfect film.""Titanic"" has the perfect cast, perfect script, perfect scenery, and the perfect director. These are only a few of the many reasons, the 1997 version of ""Titanic"" owned all the qualities that make an outstanding film. Furthermore, ""Titanic"" has great action sequences, dramatic moments, suspense, and romance. ""Titanic"" is the personification of excellence and perfection.It contained brilliant performances by Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Billy Zane and Kathy Bates. I was truly impressed by the performance of Billy Zane's Cal who was the jealous fiance to Kate Winslet's Rose. The casting director knew what he was doing when he chose Zane because the role was played with such ease. The set design and costumes that overseen by Director James Cameron was done with careful attention to detail. The accuracy of the set and costumes was superb it was not easy to tell the difference whether or not it was made or real.I have seen ""Titanic"" many many times and will continue to see as long as I own the movie because it was that well done. It continues to hold a special place in my heart and will for as long as I live.This continues to be one of the best films I have seen; everyone should SEE IT again and again.",No Rating
"Totally Overrated, bad story supported by special effects",(REBEL),5 August 1999,"As for my comments on Titanic,  It didn't start to get good until the ship went down.  I don't mean that in a bad way, but it was too slow, and was jammed with special effects, the story line was horrible, and stupid.  The whole love story is so predictable.  Not to mention the story sucked even more because you knew the ship was gonna go down and the only thing holding the story together were the special effects.  It didn't start getting good until the action kicked in when the ship was going down.  I suggest skip the first tape and start the movie on the second tape.",No Rating
An excellent film to ever hit the big screens,OriginalMovieBuff21,26 September 2004,"Titanic is an amazing epic of love and nightmares. I don't really like romantic films but this was great and pulled it off. The acting was decent but that doesn't really matter in this movie. This film launched Leonardo DiCaprio's career. James Cameron did great in directing this movie and the rest of the creators. The music made the movie. The theme music of James Cameron and the song by Celine Dion was perfect. That song is extremely famous and I sure like it a lot. The movie was beautiful and very realistic.

A sad case of the Oscar Epic bug.,jonm1998,1 May 2001,"Forget all the hype. Forget that since this tradegy happened, it has been America's most popular story.  If you strip all the attention surrounding this movie away, you're left with a big-budget film that is just that - big-budget.  The film overwhelms itself with a ridiculous amount of foreshadowing.  The acting is nothing to be accoladed.  I wasn't even impressed with the magnificent Kathy Bates' performance.  The costumes, special effects, and soundtrack were all good points in the film, however I do not like the fact that the Academy awarded this film so heavily.  It was simply an overhyped epic, not a film worthy of 11 of Hollywood's most prestigious award.  James Cameron's ego-driven direction really spoils this movie.  I would recommend seeing this movie just because it IS the tragedy of the century, but don't fall into the trap of thinking this is a quality piece of filmmaking.  I voted 5/10.",5/10
Lucky if this movie can touch your soul,nileshbahir,16 May 2022,"You had to be born in precise time and space to be lucky enough to feel this movie deep in your soul. For all may its weaknesses or flaws by modern criteria, Titanic is a love story, a sound, a vision that touches your heart unlike anything else. A movie, that's forever beautiful, fleetingly lasting characters that lasts like a beautiful dream you had on a Christmas time dawn, the soundtracks, the good and evil range of human extremities, and a numbing avoidable tragedy as a result of pride and ego, to say the least!

absolutely pitiful,bigdiedude,19 March 2007,"A poor flick all around. The only redeeming value comes from the actual sinking of the Titanic, which unfortunately doesn't happen in the first ten minutes. We do get to watch a pathetic love story between Jack & Rose. Actually more like a molestation by Rose since Jack appears to be approximately twelve years old. Very creepy. Oh yeah, horribly casted! I forgot. I can't believe I let my wife talk me into seeing this one when it came out. Let this be a lesson to you all. Cameron is definitely a second rate director and a questionable human being to boot.(Just ask Linda Hamilton) To sum it up, run far and fast from this film. It will only disappoint you.

Overrated Melodrama; Not Worth 1/16th of What it Made,michael_the_nermal,21 June 2006,"I guess people love romance and melodrama. I found that this movie would only appeal to pre-pubescent girls with a storybook notion of romance and lovey-dovey mush. This movie is one of the most highly overrated in movie history, if only because it is the most successful film ever made, and the critics seem to sing with the choir of the global audience that paid over $1 billion to watch it. The love story is, as I said, pure mush, with a cardboard (yet effeminate) villain, played by Billy Zane. The story itself is a flimsy framework to show off the grand effect of the giant ship snapping to pieces and drowning doomed computer-animated passengers. The Celine Dion song for this is atrocious (it polluted the airwaves for much of 1997), and is just as sickening as this film. The characters are bland and uncompelling, the story slow and plodding, and the special effects are the only reason to enjoy this movie.This movie belongs with the likes of any of those mushy 1980s romance or romantic comedy sort of films. For those who like melodrama, you may like ""Titanic."" Most guys will want to pass on this film, unless your girlfriends force you to watch against your own will. I personally found the story of the Mexican props crew who built the pseudo-Titanic to be far, FAR, FAR more compelling than the sappy love story between Jack and Rose.",5/10
I Hate This Movie!!!,Eric-62,2 May 1999,"When I first read Walter Lord's magnificent ""A Night To Remember"" in 1978 at the age of 9, I began a love affair with the story of the Titanic and her people that continues to this day, and it is partly responsible for my being a professional historian today.  It is because of that, that there have been few nights as disappointing to me as the one and only time I saw this movie.Yes, the technical details are brilliant, but the bottom line for any movie must be its story and characters and the manner in which James Cameron exploited the tragedy of the Titanic to tell a cheap, third-rate story of horny teenage lust that is far worse than the tawdry soap opera of the 1996 CBS miniseries ""Titanic"" continues to offend me to this day.It is not the fact that James Cameron told a fictional story at the expense of compelling real history like the Californian incident that offends me so much, it's the fact that this is a *bad* fictional story.  No one aboard the real Titanic had a situation remotely resembling the one of Jack and Rose. Why couldn't Cameron have told a fictional story revolving around something real and representative of what was on the Titanic?  If he wanted to do a class barrier romance, then why not have Jack be an honest Irish immigrant out to make a fortune in America (as so many of Titanic's steerage were) instead of some loser-drifter in life who couldn't make an honest living in the real world beyond Titanic? (Jack strikes me as the working class Gaylord Ravenal.  Someone who in ten years is going to be just as bad as Cal is) Or better still, why not a story of a young newlywed couple that was parted by the tragedy?  God knows there were plenty of those couples aboard Titanic, but I guess in this day and age of Hollywood morals, ""true love"" can not exist between a married couple, thus rendering that idea politically incorrect in James Cameron's eyes.  And so we get the false dichotomy in which a person's capacity to love is measured by his poverty, a message that is not only stupid in and of itself but also false to the reality of what was on Titanic (one need only point to the true love that existed between the Strauses, who perhaps not coincidentally had all their key scenes left on the cutting room floor).There is so much more I could rant about (the demeaning depictions of First Officer Murdoch and Molly Brown also come to mind), but the bottom line is that as a Titanic enthusiast I feel disgusted that James Cameron has hijacked any hope that one day someone could make a movie about the Titanic with modern technology that did justice to her, just as ""A Night To Remember"" so brilliantly did in 1958.  For me, ""A Night To Remember"" and the 1979 TV-movie ""SOS Titanic"" remain the definitive Titanic movies and should be seen as antidotes to this horrid mess.",No Rating
Nothing can sink Titanic in FIlm Industry,joseannastasia,16 January 2021,"I watched it when i was 10, when I have no Idea abt romance thing. I watched it again when I hit 17.

probably the worst film James Cameron has ever made,lasse-uk,21 October 2004,"I don't even know where to begin, there are so many flaws mistakes and general errors. Hey I know how about starting by saying that the script is absolutely dreadful. Nothing happens for three whole hours. After an hour you just sit there and wait for the ship to sink already. I couldn't help cheering when the ship finally sunk. OK I admit there are a few good scenes in the film. For an example at the end of the film someone falls down and hits one of the propellers and makes a kind of dull ""bong"" sound when he does it and then starts spinning rapidly in the air. Most of the effects are alright but the general acting as well as the weak and boring story makes this the worst big budget film ever made perhaps aside from the Harry Potter series.

Too many things wrong,nunoproenca,19 December 2012,"I will not deny that the special effects and sinking ship drama (for the other passengers) are fantastic, but there are simply too many things in the remainder of the movie that tick me off, and prevent me from giving it a higher rating.The romance characters, dialogues and situations are way too clich√©. The instant love at first sight scene? The ""She's not for you"" advice? The way Kate Winslet changes the moment she sees the rich woman mistreating her daughter? The evil fianc√©e? The lively and dancing 3rd class people? It is just far too silly and contrived.There's also one thing that bothers me. Everyone is happy that Leo and Kate are reunited at the end. Well, she got married and had kids, didn't she? So, that means she probably spend several years with a husband. So...instead of the father of her children, she wants to spend eternity with a guy she met as a teenager for 5(!) days? I'd be royally mad off if I was the guy.",3/10
Legendary film,leonspikov,19 January 2022,"The cast in the film is just wonderful, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet don't look perfect, but in my opinion they are very harmonious.

Agree that the role of the handsome scoundrel was 100% successful for him.The picture impresses not only with the power that the director of the film (Titanic) shows us, but also perhaps with the relationship between the main characters, which make us worry with the heroes every minute... Therefore, in my opinion, the film is not only about love, but also about tragedy, hope and faith...Despite the fact that the film was released in 1997, I think many will agree with me that it still pleasantly impresses with graphics and special effects, which fascinate even now, 24 years later.Undoubtedly, I recommend the movie ""Titanic"" to you as.",10/10
What's Going On?,drosse67,17 March 2002,"I feel compelled to be the 900th or so person who's probably commenting on this movie.  Right now, this movie is about as popular as the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack was in 1981, and to this I say:  Hogwash.  No one seemed to mind in 1997, when people were lining up to see this movie three or four times.  Now the same people are trashing it.  Urgh.  But it doesn't surprise me.  When it comes to movies, we tend to get brainwashed by other movielovers and critics, and if they imply ""we made a mistake--this movie is really awful,"" we tend to believe it. I watched Titanic in its entirety again the other day and I must go against the current grain and say that it is a great movie (or should I say, still a great movie).  People who have not seen this movie on a large screen cannot say that they've seen this movie.  Period.  So go away.  I will agree with most and say that the acting is pretty bad (and the movie did not pick up any Oscars in the acting category).  James Cameron may be an arrogant jerk. And the screenplay is corny.  But the sheer awesomeness of the film is what I remembered when I saw it on the big screen in 1997.  Cameron, despite his personal faults, took us on that doomed luxury liner, literally transporting us back to 1912.  Yes, it could be argued that movies like ""A Night to Remember"" were better examinations of Titanic's final hours, and IMAX productions like Titanica had better footage of the ship at the bottom of the Atlantic.  But Cameron's ""kitchen sink"" approach to telling the story, which includes a trite but still rather sweet fictional love story,is what captivated audiences in 1997.  Give this movie twenty years.  People will rediscover its magic after the predictable backlash has worn off.  Hey, even Alice Cooper is admitting today that Saturday Night Fever is a great album.",No Rating

Touching & Sensational. A Timeless Masterpiece.,k-dhesi,21 May 2009,"The movie Titanic makes it much more then just a ""night to remember."" It re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten. Why so criticised? I have no idea. Could/will they ever make a movie like Titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it. Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece. It will be almost impossible.The director no doubt had the major impact on the film. A simple disaster film (boring to watch) converted to an unbelievable romance. Yes I'm not the Romance type either, but that should not bother you, because you will never see a romance like this. Guaranteed! Everything to the amazing effects, to the music, to the sublime acting. The movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and live. The legend herself ""TITANIC"" is shown brilliantly in all classes, too looks, too accommodation. The acting was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best at playing there roles. No one could have done better. They are partly the reason why the film is so great. I guess it's not too much to talk about. The plot is simple, The acting is brilliant, based on a true story, Probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears, thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten.

Titanic,itscalvinbowers-87021,11 July 2020,"It makes me question the legitimacy of modern-day film criticism when I see films like this constantly getting thrown under the bus for a supposed ""lack of substance"". The discussion surrounding the medium as a whole has been spat on for years due to the ludicrous mentality that big budget blockbusters somehow have less validity than arthouse cinema or anything else outside of the usual wide release theater-fare. All genres deserve to stand shoulder to shoulder with one another, as they're all pieces of art and should be appreciated as such.James Cameron's 'Titanic' released in 1997 and became an instant classic, though a somewhat controversial one. It shattered every record imaginable and won countless awards for its bold style, immaculate set design, and groundbreaking everything. It was huge, and the film itself compliments that sentiment. The biggest boat in the world, the greatest love story ever told, and the most tragic disaster of the century. The sheer scale and spectacle of this film is incredible. It was massive, and even with an industry now focused on world ending events and apocalypses of all shapes and sizes, it still remains massive today.'Titanic' follows Rose, a seventeen-year-old aristocrat who, despite her luxurious life, is unsatisfied and longs for something more. She meets and subsequently falls in love with Jack, a poor artist who won his ticket in a game of poker. A very basic setup, right? One that we've all seen a thousand times before. The difference is, this is the one that everyone remembers. This is what separates this love story from other love stories: It's memorable. Clich√©s aren't bad, I honestly believe that they're essential to storytelling. It's what you do with them that matters. James Cameron takes a somewhat basic love story about two people from different worlds falling in love with each other despite their differences and puts it inside a disaster of monumental scale. We all know that the unsinkable ship will inevitably sink, but its everything before that - the characters - the buildup - the overconfidence that all the passengers and crew uphold - it plants the idea in your head that maybe, just maybe, it'll be different this time. The events that transpire before the sinking is what makes it all the more impactful. If it was just a random ship filled with people you don't care about, it wouldn't affect you. Instead, it's a real world tragedy with characters that you've spent hours watching grow and evolve.Themes of perseverance, freedom, and love are represented beautifully here. Images like the violinists trying to maintain a sense of duty and composure amidst the chaos will forever be ingrained in my head. My Heart Will Go On by C√©line Dion is not only a beautiful piece of music, but it connects to what I think is, the central theme of the film. Remembrance. Push forward, but never forget. Rose promises Jack to survive and live her life, but she'll always remember her short, but magical time on the ship all those years ago.Despite the groundbreaking nature of 'Titanic', that's not what first comes to mind when talking about this film. It's the characters, the journey, and the story that's captured the hearts of many moviegoers and film fans alike. That's what was discussed when it released, that's what we discuss now, and that's what will be discussed for generations to follow.",10/10

"Simple, predictable,and awful",chegevera,8 March 2001,"Titanic is probably one of the worst films of the 90's. Cameron must've sold his soul to the devil for it to get an academy award. To be thought of as a better movie over than As Good As It Gets or Good Will Hunting. THIS WILL GIVE AWAY THE ENDING! One of the things I hated most about this film is the predictability. From the first time she met Jack, I knew he was going to Die. It was so easy to forsee. I also hate how much of a copy this was of almost every simple romance story, Girl about to marry snob, meets slightly poor, funny guy, falls in love, something prevents, then at end they are together. It was probably as simple as it gets. I also hate how farfetched the plot was. If Cameron had done ANY research prior to writing it, he would have realized how a romance like that would have NEVER happened. During 1910's American & England people married and dated within their economic class. I also hate this film because it was so shallow, unlike past Academy Award Best Picture Winners, Titanic had NO societal meaning, No symbolism, and No Metaphors. Usually after watching films bestowed with that honor, you feel changed, different, with Titanic I was just disappointed.Lastly the acting was poor, at best, except for that of Billy Zane's, which was phenomenal. They picked actors singularly for looks rather than acting ability. Winslet showed little to no emotion, and Decaprio could never pull off any of the sad scenes.

The film that broke every box office record on release and wore the box office champion crown for many years(until it was overtaken by Jim Cameron's Avatar) is special because not only does it showcase the Titanic disaster in all its glory the film is a technical achievement of the highest order.The sinking sequence is astonishing and it feels like you are watching the actual ship sink. The characters and actors are amazing and even with a large running length you never dare look at the watch. James Cameron is a master director and Titanic is his stamp of authority.Thanks.,9/10
Dreamland,meissotruey,10 November 2019,"This movie is like the source of life, it filled me with different emotions, I felt real warmness, I felt suspense, I felt empathy. It filled me with good emotions, refreshed my mind in some way, I absolutely in love with it. And I think, everything about this movie is great, EXCEPT scenes from ""nowadays"" : I can't see any emotions on the face of this old lady, I hate this thing, when she tells something and It feels like I SHOULD feel sorry for this non - acting bag with bones, because I KNOW that she is Rose, this is the point when me and you MOST feel sorry, cheap trick. No hate to this actress, but to the director, I just hate this useless old living.
Nobody ever asked you to invite 87 year old actress, if you can't find any acting one, then cut this scene, use cosmetics, do anything that not harms the movie. I think that all those scenes spoils the great movie and without them it can be called a masterpiece. These people are useless, they take my time, they don't do anything, these scenes not ever look that great like Titanic story itself! All that they do is playing cheap emotional games "" feel sorry for me""; ""look at something you know"" and this is disgusting! I feel really mad about that part, and I feel sad for such a great movie. I would recommend you to skip all of them and enjoy this piece of art.",9/10
Worth Looking for Only for the Action Sequences and Camera Work (Some Spoilers),TMC-4,23 February 2000,"Titanic really isn't very involving in terms of its drama as it starts out. At this point, main thing that can be really worth observing is the camera work.  There are numerous long shots the movie progress, you are able to gain more of a interest with the story around the ship and its atmosphere. It that can help grab a hold on to the scenery fairly well.  As occasionally cuts back to the present day setting were the movie begins but not on a constant basis.  The drama itself at times feels to be lacking.  It tends to force several situations for dramatic impact.  Most of the bulk in Titanic belongs to the sinking of the ship.  The process of these action sequences is seemingly carefully and well constructed but along the way, it falls into various repetitious situations and dialog (e.g. the lines ""Come back"", ""Oh shi*"", and ""Never let go"").  For example, we either see children standing around and crying or crew members (who set an example of the one-dimensional supporting characters and in the process of this type of scenes usually gets punched) arguing with a group of passengers who paths are blocked.  Any other way, this period in the movie (albeit going on forever) is still interesting since it's obviously at moment of panic.",No Rating
"A loathsome, sick and twisted movie!",luke2578,15 May 2002,"In the past 6 months, I have looked back on this movie in retrospect and thought what a totally sick premise this film is based upon. It's a fictional tale of a true tragedy, which trivialises the impact of the Titanic sinking.James Cameron has the sickest mind I have ever known of. ""Let's make a love story on one of the greatest disasters the world has ever heard about."" Back in 1997, the movie execs must have been rubbing their hands together at the prospect of James Cameron (whose blockbusters have accrued masses of cash) doing a romantic movie on a poignant slice of history. However, around 2,500 people died on that ship, yet we only really focus on Jack and Rose running around the ship. Of course, this was Cameron's intention, so as to show the ship in all it's glory before it sank.The problem I have with the movie is that it's the equivalent of making a movie about a love story in the Twin Towers. A young business man in Tower A falls in love with a young business woman in Tower B. The man goes to Tower B, gets the girl and runs around all the floors of the Twin Towers (to show what the Twin Towers looked like before they collapsed). Then the planes hit the buildings and the story really kicks off. You get the idea. Entertainment based on a real-life tragedy, to me, seems really sick. It is a lot worse than programmes that the Daily Mail in Britain kick up a stink about.Morally wrong pictures like this should be banned, rather than Britain's banning of ""The Exorcist"" for 20 years, especially as Titanic was crap.",2/10
Very over-rated,a234andrew,5 August 2002,"I believe that Titanic is the most over-rated movie of all time. Its plot is un-original (boy meets girl, falls in love, than heartbreak), its script is un-original and its acting is mediocre. The only reason its #1 in money is: The titanics fame, and teeny bopper girls that watch it over 30 times in the theatre during its release. If everyone only watched it once, it would probably be in 15th or 20th place. Atleast there can't be a sequal!",1/10
One of best film of Hollywood,robertofuiano,28 September 2008,"beautiful film. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is ""better"" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. For edward shossor hand 7.6.

"The sad story of a couple in which the man drowns...and oh yes, it was onboard the Titanic.",mauriceyoung-49925,4 October 2022,There is obviously a huge amount of work gone into the making of this film. However it comes across to me as a fictional episode of melodrama of the usual love and tears that you see on everyday afternoon television with the sinking of a ship thrown in to give it a dynamic twist. The Titanic was the 'star' of this disaster not a love stricken couple wandering around on board trying to sort out there pathetic problems. I've watched this film 'Titanic' twice but also an earlier film of the Titanic disaster 'A Night to Remember' made in black and white in 1958 and by far a superior version of the tragedy.,2/10
Best movie of all time!,LDRmuffin,11 November 2018,"2018 and I still watch it and still love it! This is a brilliant movie ever! Leo should get an Oscar tbh, hehe.",10/10
Why is this considered good?,Engage_With_Zorp,11 October 2008,"I've never understood why this film garnered such critical and financial success. I've heard it said that it made so much money because teen girls kept going to see it over and over again due to Leo DiCaprio, but I don't think that's the case; I think some people just really liked this film.Which of course mystifies me. The plot is the stockiest of stock plots; high-society girl falls in love with lower-class, but fun-loving rogue. Cue sappy music. But oh, conflict! She's already engaged to someone else, but he's kind of a jerk and she doesn't really love him (I know, it surprised me, too). At the end, the boat sinks, of course, and Leo DiCaprio dies, apparently having realized that the movie he's in is no good.Do you see the problem here? Every aspect of this film is utterly predictable, every single character is a character we've seen countless time in other, better films, and yet the stupid thing is almost three-and-a-half hours long. It spends so much time ""developing"" these characters and situations that we've all seen before, one has to wonder if writer-director Cameron actually thinks he's done anything original here. Indeed, I found myself predicting scenes before they happened, and I was almost always right on the money - with the exception of the fact that the dialogue I had in my head was less cheesy and hackneyed than what was displayed on screen. The only mildly interesting part of the entire affair is the sinking of the ship, and even then I want everyone to hurry up and die so the movie can just END already.Unfortunately, the actors aren't even at their best here. DiCaprio is downright dreadful, which wouldn't be so unfortunate if he hadn't displayed far greater acting talent than he did here in just about every other movie he's ever been in. Winslet doesn't fare much better, but she does what she can with what's given her. What's worse, great actors and actresses are severely underused, as in the case of Kathy Bates, who is given a criminally small amount of screen time.In short - uninteresting characters, a predictable plot, cringe-inducing writing, and decent-to-dreadful acting make viewing this film a rather unpleasant business. The ending is good, but that's only by virtue of the phenomenal special effects - and special effects do not a good movie make (see: the Star Wars prequels).So, with all that in mind, again I ask ... why is this considered good?",4/10
A testament to the marvels of humankind,BuckyLeBoeuf,8 June 2023,What a freaking achievement. On so many levels. Craft and story combine to blow your mind and evaporate your heart.The time and care that went into this is staggering. A masterful achievement by the human species.And what a genius decision by James Camera to invest so much screen time first and foremost to the love story before diving into the historic tragedy. A lesser filmmaker wouldn't have spent so much time making it a romance and as a result the magnitude of the tragedy wouldn't have hit as hard.Everyone makes a big hullaballoo about the floating door at the end but it didn't bother me.,10/10
Brutally awesome and incredibly sad,Marc_Israel_365,26 April 2013,"It isn't the romantic tale of rich girl-poor boy ingrained into many hearts due to Kate & Leo and it isn't the recreation of history with poetic license.... It's making me believe I'm seeing that ship sink every time I watch. Kudos to James Cameron, with a nod to the frightening Francis Fisher as the aristocratic Mother pimping out her daughter and Billy Zane whom without his sneer Titanic wouldn't have sailed so far. I'll put up with Leo calling out ""Rose, Rose"" another thousand times to again watch this disaster movie with the romantic hook. A Night To Remember tells the straight tale, but Titanic is certainly personalized with Camerons' storytelling.",9/10
"A compressed, well acted, directed etcetera and well funded soap opera",miaalike,16 April 2022,"Beyond the creative story grafted on the Titanic real life events, this is exactly so - making that story stick, around a couple of unfortunate lovers. Populating said story with other characters, appropriate suits, music, suspense and so on. If that is not the concept that soap operas take to unbearable lengths, don't know what it is.The movie does not shed much light over the social classes or condition at the time (can do that, but it is somehow marginal), does not depict very deep characters (they may be, but they do not waste time self analysing), and the story is focused on one thing - to be compelling, and appropriately match the huge ship and its story. That is all. It does not even mirror the Titanic story, it just uses it as a background. And it keeps one glued to the screen by taking all they could and investing it into the characters and details, with the force specific to British productions, frankly, when you have to take them seriously just because they take themselves so seriously.The rest is just glorifying the mass effect, turning a human drama (or tragedy) -movie into a legend. Looking back on it and just pointing a very academic finger, apparently, and saying ""this is a masterpiece"".If a somehow similar movie would have followed in the history of cinema, only deeper, this would not have been so important.",6/10
"Stop it, just stop it, or I'll scream!",ecomcon-2,14 June 1999,"Has the world gone utterly mad? ""Titanic"" is the best/greatest/most wonderfullest movie of all time? Nooooooooooo!Come on, people, let's get a few things straight.First the good news: (1) ""Titanic"" had lovely (and seemingly accurate) costuming, (2) beautiful sets, (3) first-rate special effects (okay, let's call the F/X spectacular), and (4) a gorgeous musical score. Overall, I was so touched at the end of the movie that my eyes were filled with tears (for some strange reason my wife finds my sentimentality amusing).Now the bad news: (1) the scripting was awful (some of the dialogue that came out of the characters' mouths made me winch with pain), (2) the characterizations were weak and predictable (there was no doubt as to who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. All the good guys were totally good, all the bad guys were totally bad. If you ever want to see a person who has both good AND evil qualities all you need to do is look in the mirror: it's called human nature), (3) some scenes can only be described as vulgar Disneyesque (who can forget that romantic ""I'll jump your bones you in the back of the car number?"" Oh, and let's not forget the hand running down the window, now that was touching), (4) blame the script all you want, but the acting was weak, and finally, (5) one of the worst scenes in a motion picture: the infamous ""I'll teach you how to spit"" scene. That was in such bad taste. With the possible exception of really uncouth adolescents, who could watch that scene and not be repelled?Okay, now that I've gotten that off my chest I feel so much better.To conclude, no, ""Titanic"" was NOT the best movie of all time, nor was it the worst. It's a must-see movie, no doubt about it. It is a great movie if you like black-and-white characters with a color-by-numbers story line. Unfortunately if you demand complex characters, solid acting, and credible plots you will be sorely disappointed.",6/10
"Good movie, but worth all those oscars? I don't think so!",tfluppe,2 July 2002,"Sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change. The first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I am not the only one to think this) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, When is this d**n ship going to sink??? And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but definetly not great either. Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film, I mean who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He does 1 half-good movie and won't do a film for less than $20 million. And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it. But enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together. There is one lesson to be learned about this movie: there are too many love-stories as it is, filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie!!! Out of a possible 100% I give this film a mere 71%.",7/10
A big waste of money.,Roon,23 November 1998,"When I first heard, that James Cameron was going to make a film about Titanic, I had big expectations. I thought that it was going to be a movie that would stun me. Sadly it was a big disappointment. The movie never interested me, I was bored and never stunned by the special effects. The sinking of Titanic was a disaster and Cameron never gave me the impression that it was a disaster. I never saw real emotions, it all came down on overacting and commercial emotions. I guess for someone who doesn't see as many movies as I do, Titanic will be a great movie. The movie never worked up to its expections and it never showed why it had cost so much money. I think most people love the film because the commercials told them it was the greatest movie ever. Also the acting of both main characters was below every expectation, this is proven by the fact that none of them won an Acadamy award.",1/10
What a piece of whale excrement!!!,bs122782,19 April 1999,"Brilliant visual effects along lavish sets and costumes do not a great movie make.First and foremost, that horrible, cliche-ridden, cheesy screenplay with those stereotypical characters right out of central casting.The acting: Billy Zane should be suspended from the Screen Actors Guild as punishment for the most severe case of ham acting I've seen in 30 years of moviegoing. Leonardo DiCaprio (who can occasionally do good work) is out of his element. He's a valley boy trying to a historical piece. Even an actress as talented and beautiful as Kate Winslett can't make that cheesy dialogue work. Kathy Bates is good but her role is little more than a cameo. And Victor Garber's delicate performance as architect Thomas Andrews allows him to subtly steal the few scenes he is in. Frances Fisher and Gloria Stewart are embarrassing to watch just what the heck is going on between Bill Paxton and Suzy Amis in that ridiculous story bookend. The rest of the cast seems to have been inspired by the central casting stock character actors of the 1930's (the high society snob; the bumbling billionaire and his heavily accented manservant; the poor pitiful Irish peasants; the arrogant industrialist; the hero's comically zany best friend who meets an untimely death; the first class gentlemen who behave like gentlemen while the third class men push women and children out of the way to get on the lifeboats, I could go on and on...James Cameron direction has a few inspired moments (mostly some interesting camera angles) but for the most part each scene tries to out cliche the previous one.To see a real movie about the Titanic with real characters and real story rent ""A Night to Remember"".",No Rating

The greatest film of all time.,akhanna-28238,30 May 2017,"3000 men worked for two years to build the most gigantic ship of all time,The Titanic,the ship which couldn't sink. 2208 bid farewell to southampton in april 1912.Little did they know that this unsinkable ship was going to sink on its maiden voyage itself. Tragedy struck,1503 people died leaving the whole world shell- shocked. Good story for a movie,right? So James Cameron decided to do it.Years of obsession,research,plotting and 200 million USD went into making this film making it the costliest and the riskiest film of all time. The result? Titanic became the highest grossing movie ever and is still the 2nd highest grosssing film of all time,only 2nd to james cameron's own avatar. What makes the film so special? Its the way it unfolds,the way it is engineered by cameron. The writing,special effects are beyond brilliant,the fictional part of the film has become iconic,everything clicks. When the movie starts,during 1st few seconds,the background music plays and right there you know that this film is going to be special,it goes on for more than 3 hours and in those 3 hours,we are told the great story of the titanic. We get to experience the splendour of the ship,know the perspective of ALL the characters and that in my opinion is where the film wins. Cameron lets us to see the things from every character's perspective,be it jack,fabrizio,rose,her mother,her fianc√©,her fiance's right hand,the captain,the passengers,EVERYONE. We see how they see things and it is amazing. The tragedy is shown in perhaps the best possible way.The thrill,the tension,the fascination,the grandeur,the love,the tragedy,in these 200 minutes,we experience it all. Kudos to Cameron for making this unforgettable and immortal piece of cinema which will be watched and loved by generations to come. From a guy who has seen the whole film in excess of 130 times and is still in awe of this magical story,here's a piece of advise- watch this film now if u haven't. It will stay with u for a very,very long time. U don't watch titanic,u experience titanic. The best of the best!",10/10
a classic movie!,emilie8605,17 December 2003,"this movie had to be one of the best movies of all time. (**SPOILER**) when the two of them are in love, regardless of social class, and hold on the very end, made me cry until i couldnt cry no more. leo dicaprio did an outstanding performance as jack, since i really couldnt picture him being that outstanding of an actor, after i saw romeo and juilet..enough said for that. and then kate winslet breaks in, being the opposite leading lady, and made herself known, in my opinion, as a good actress. i hope that this movie will let others see social standing are no barrier for love, since love is the strongest element that i believe is needed.  the man that played the supposed love interest, billy zane, did not a bad job himself. he really had me convinced of having a jeolous side and had me wishing that someone would just kill him off or something. but the love story appears to be the main focus of the movie. the sinking of the ship carried thousands of souls, and many of them probably had a love tale of their own. the experience of the ship sinking was remarkable, and truly made me feel i was there, and seeing the (**SPOILER**) old people on the bed and the children being tucked in as the ship sails away, since they know that they have no chance of surviving, since the first class had to get off first.  that really triggered an emotion inside me that had me crying for a long time as the ship slowly sinks to the bottom of the ocean.  appreciate the movie and enjoy it to the best of your ability. a definite tearjerker with some of everything to offer the movie.

An Epic Love Story LIke No Other,jaddison383,25 June 2007,"Titanic is probably the most unlikely successful films of all time. It really was no kind of provocative theme at center. It was quite simply an epic, and an epic LOVE STORY at that. Yet, this film went on to be the most successful movie of all time, both in the box office and the awards seasons.The movie does what many people thought would be absolutely impossible- It takes you back to the Titanic and truly captures exactly what it must have felt like when the ""unsinkable"" ship went down. Through a love story that moves everyone who sees it, characters that are diverse and fascinating, and probably the best cinematography ever put on screen, it makes you feel about this story in a way you've never felt before. And that's what makes it so amazing. It changed the way people looked at this story forever. It made them truly understand the tragedy of what happened that night.The acting is fantastic. Leonardo Dicaprio does a fine job and was very under-appreciated for this performance. However, the reason for that is because no one could take their eyes off of Kate Winslet. This movie made her what she is today. Her performance is still fantastic as you watch it even now. The movie was hers from the moment she came on screen.It's true that it is, at heart, a love story, but it's not only about the two central characters of Jack and Rose. To me, the real love story is about the Titanic itself. Before I saw this movie, it was an interesting story and that was all. Because of this movie, and the vividness it portrayed, it is a story I'll never forget. It's become a story that will never die in the hearts of people, and the movie is what truly did that. It changed the way that people thought of Titanic forever.I think Bill Paxton's character said it best right at the end: ""All my life I've thought of nothing but Titanic, but I never really got it until now."" I understand Mr. Paxton- I feel the same way. An absolutely fantastic film, and probably one of the best ever made. 9/10 stars! Jay Addison",9/10
A film that never fails to tell a difficult story in an interesting and tragic way,richardclarke13,29 January 2006,"The critics had the knives out for James Cameron's masterpiece long before its release. They were going to criticise its for being too long, too boring, badly acted, Badly directed etc. But when Cameron released this film (about a subject that has been a lifelong fascination of mine and his) the critics were silenced and the film did all the talking.And boy did it talk! It become the first film in history to make 1 billion dollars and no other film has quite caught the publics imagination like it. It tells a simple story set against the backdrop of the biggest maritime disaster yet. Rose Dewitt Bukater (kate winslet) is unhappily boarding the titanic with her overtly snobby partner Cal (Billy Zane) and her family and while attempting suicide meets Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and straightaway falls in love with him as though he is from a different class he shows her a different more enjoyable life than the one she is having with Cal.Titanic shows you triumph over disaster in all its shapes and forms. Titanic is also a story about the great class divide which used to exist (some people say it still does) and though you know the outcome watching this film for the 1st time or the hundredth time doesn't fail to intrigue. Although factually incorrect in parts (especially in the case of officer William Murdoch who despite his portrayal in the film as a bad guy who shot himself actually was a good guy who went down with the ship) this is the most true adaptation of this story. It won 11 Oscars in 1998 (equalling the haul of all about eve and Ben hur!) including the biggie, best picture and has won universal praise from cinema-goers but not so from some of those critics who have largely lambasted it (showing once and for all that there is a world of difference between critic and cinema goer) the acting (particularly from DiCaprio, Winslet and Zane) is exemplary and earns titanic the film as much a place in history as the event itself. A modern masterpiece.",10/10
The dumbing down of a terrible tragedy,Alfriend,21 February 2006,"There were so many utterly uncanny true stories that occurred during the few days of the Titanic's only voyage that absolutely stagger the imagination. The fates revolved around this incident like a Greek Tragedy. How can you ruin a tale like this. Well, James Cameron has done it. He decides that truth is not stranger than fiction and rights a trite and superficial story of two star-crossed lovers and wastes our time with their wishy-washy story. He could have written the tale of the two lovers, cut down (or cut out)on the nonsense with Billy Zane and his evil butler gamely played by talented David Warner and spent some time including some of the real stories that captivated viewers of the numerous documentaries over many years.The cast is rife with talent, but in this film, Cameron has directed the actors a' la George Lucas, who also has a gift for making talented actors look stiff.This movie doesn't hold a candle to any of the previous films especially the 1953 Clifton Webb/Barbara Stanwick version. Now that was high melodrama done so well. To be honest the effects are even comparable. The film is still quite moving today. This is one more film like Independence Day, Pearl Harbor and the three recent Star Wars films that would have been total flops without the special effects. And many of the effects were not that good. There are too many scenes where the warm waters of the Mexican waters are clearly evident.What a waste and a sad testament to the true and awesome tragedy.",No Rating
good god...,mules82,8 November 2002,"Warning!!!!  Spoilers!!!!  To an extent, though this movie sucks so I'm doing you a favor.Titanic puts the 'retard' in 'retarded.'  Easily one of the top 5 worst movies of all time.  Anyone who cried at the end of this film should immediately try and start beef with LW, better known as twin glocks. Tasting the cold steel through your medula would be a much better option than continuing with your pathetic existence.  This movie was not funny at all, the lead female was morbidly obese and the hero was the homeless vagrant from Growing Pains, I assume Alan Thicke was too busy hosting episodes of Pictionary to be available for the movie.  Anyway, how this trite piece of garbage made money is beyond me.  The whole movie was pointless so I'll just cut to the end, the only remotely funny part.  The kid from Growing Pains is freezing his nuts off in the water while his fat beast girlfriend is floating on some wooden raft all warm and comfy.  There is easily enough room for the two of them, however, she refuses to let him on.  I bet that kid never saw this coming when he was living in that Janitor's closet on Growing Pains before the Seavers took him in.  Anyway, the Growing Pains guy eventually dies, however, instead of floating on the surface like all the other corpses in the water, the Growing Pains hobo for some reason sinks to the bottom.  While all this is happening the fat girl is crying, I don't know why.  She clearly could have saved him by just moving over a few inches and sharing a bit of the raft.  Perhaps she just misplaced her twinkies.  Anyway she struggles to blow some whistle then some British guy saves her, the end, this movie was atrocious.",2/10
The most unbelievable true story someone ever made up.,Monty-Python,22 January 1999,"When I went to see this film, I was expecting something truly great.  I was sadly very disappointed.  The characters were generally poorly developed, leaving me with a sickly sweet after taste, rather than a feeling of sorrow or compassion. Whilst the talent gathered (Winslet, Zane) hinted at true acting ability (they have provided far better performances in other films), the script is lacking in anything other than schoolgirl Mills and Boon. The technical effects have obviously been done to high standards, as the boat looks impressive, but that is where it ends, as the man-child DiCaprio slaughters the basest of emotional lines, as makes the romance seem cliched and below par. If you absolutely must see this film, see it on the silver screen, as the lack of grandeur which is displayed on the small screen leaves only the ""acting"" to behold.",1/10
6 critical reasons why this was an excellent film,c.huddle-lamb,19 December 2001,"Less mystifying than the success of this film is the negative response it received from most critics. It has been labelled a spectacle of death, adolescent, banal, and (most damning of all) Hollywood. (Hollywood's become an adjective now, apparently.) At least five of my friends would not see it because Leonardo diCaprio is a teen idol, and they feel above associating with that kind of thing. The dialogue is pitched at a very general level - the last thing you'd call it is poetic. I think part of what rubbed so many critics the wrong way, is that this is a completely new approach to the Victorian romance. (I know, 1912 isn't precisely Victorian, but it's close, and as the 'Edwardian romance' isn't really a genre, that's what people will be comparing this with.) Room With A View this ain't. It is, however, reminiscent in many respects with Thomas Hardy's novels. Here are some of it's features:
Technically, Titanic is really cutting edge. High quality special FX (though a few problems rendering the CGI passengers). It's good enough to double as a documentary. The characters are fictional, but really, is anyone dumb enough not to realise that? There's real footage of the real Titanic at the bottom of the ocean, really tricky stuff involving shooting underwater, and a strong knowledge and portrayal of the mechanical workings of the ship. It won the Special FX Oscar for good reason.It's the first special FX romance. Sure there have been FX movies with romances in them, but only as an accompaniment to the testosterone pumping hero. Titanic makes the statement (perhaps inadvertently) that technology can be relevant to a woman's story as well. (More recently, we've seen Charlie's Angels, and I think we'll see more in the future - but Titanic was the first, as well as the only one that's really a 'chick-flick'). This doesn't necessarily make Titanic a good film, but it is a point of interest.It's complex, yet logically consistent. When a plot works as smoothly as in Titanic, it's easy to overlook how clever it is. There are a lot of characters, but we never get confused. Every character is logically consistent. Every scene, every visual, every word moves the story forward. This film not only uses the classic 'Hero's Journey', it uses it for four subjects simultaneously: Rose (the heroine, played by Kate Winslet), the ship, the archaeologist, and the diamond. Each of these subjects has a story that stands alone. Rose and the ship are inextricably linked, and their stories parallel almost exactly. A lot of Rose's internal dialogue could be applied to the ship without changing a word, and their social roles are very similar. It's a clever technique that makes us relate to the ship's fate by identifying with Rose, and vice versa. Likewise, the archaeologist allows us to bridge the gap from our 20th century cynicism into Rose's story. The film doesn't expect us to care about this ship straight away, it works to persuade us, and the audience's 'journey' is mirrored in that of the archaeologist. (By the way, if you think this doesn't sound very hard, go ahead and try it, sucker.)I mentioned Thomas Hardy earlier. James Cameron has Hardy's eye for real-world detail, and a way of realising its significance. More particularly, they both have a lot to say about women, the industrial revolution, British Imperialism, and class - and they seem to arrive at the same conclusions. The dialogue concentrates on being true-to-life rather than poetic - right down to accents, turn-of-phrase, and foreign words being subtitled (where necessary, which isn't often). This is also true of gestures, costumes, technology, music, art, and other cultural particularities. A great deal of thought and research has been expended. All this to give us a film that creates more than characters and a story, it's a film that recreates a world.Awesome recognition of theme, metaphor, and myth. Personally, this is the aspect of Titanic that really blows me away. James Cameron not only recognised a good story here, but he figures out why it's important, and translates that onto the screen. The first, and most obvious point, is that the ship becomes a microcosm of British society. Graphically and spatially people are divided according to telling social conventions - cf first and third class accomodation. Cf the position and costumes of women and men. And because he's working from a true story, Cameron makes his point without being tokenistic. It embodies a Christian tri-partite world, with the hellish boiler chambers below, and the almost heavenly freedom on the decks above. The Captain and crew sit on high and order how everything will be run. The machinery (representing the industrial revolution) is awesome, remarkable, but ultimately fails when it becomes an end in and of itself. It is a classic tragedy that tells of human ambition, power, and pride. It is a Romeo & Juliet tale of the love that crosses all boundaries. It incorporates Icarus and metaphorical fairy godmothers. It's the ship of fools, the journey from the Old World to the New, and Man against Nature (and the gendered nature of the concept is explored). But it does all this with a particularity of circumstance that takes these themes/myths/ideas, and reinvents them. Then it turns up the pressure - first by bottling these people onto a large (but still conspicuously finite ship); then, as the ship sinks, taking that room and making it smaller and smaller. People are forced to make choices. Push comes to shove. And the good, the bad, and very ugly side of human nature is disturbingly brought to life.Finally, Titanic has an emphasis on communication. It takes a vast amount of complex information and communicates it clearly and succinctly. It is the kind of layered film that anyone can watch and understand, but the more you look into it, the more you find. It's very visual - in such a way that you could turn the sound down and you'd get all the important details. It shows, it doesn't tell. Despite the technical wizardry producing it required, and the huge numbers of people to co-ordinate, the film looks unified and never falters in its pacing, themes, or story. It remains masterfully under the director's control, and it lives and breathes his enthusiasm.",10/10
A Cinematic Ode to Human Memory....,pheluda,27 April 2008,"The first time I happened to watch Titanic (the movie), I was barely into my teenage years and barely out of primary school. Naturally, what I found to be most appealing (apart from the delights of a naked Kate Winslet) was the brilliant way in which this true human tragedy had been brought on screen ¬ñ the grand sets, the accurate reproduction, the seamless special effects (in case you're wondering, I grew up to be an engineer). It left quite a mark on me ¬ñ I confess to have seen hundreds of documentaries on how and why 'The Unsinkable Ship' dropped to the bottom of the ocean on its maiden voyage, so much so that I had become a self-professed guru on any and every Titanic factoid¬Ö Many repeat viewings later, I've developed a slightly different perspective towards this piece of cinema that still never ceases to amaze me. I'm in my twenties now, and have had my fair share of experiences ¬ñ crush, heartbreak, love, et al (all the necessary experiences that are a pre-requisite for one to truly appreciate the world's favourite 'chick-flick'). I've realized that with time, my favourite portions from the movie have changed. Whereas earlier, I would happily skip the first half but never fail to catch the second, now I find myself to be fonder of the first hour, and even fonder of the last half. A part of the reason would be the advancement in digital effects since that time, which have given me the ability to grudgingly spot sections where the seamless computer effects don't seem to be so, well, seamless any more.The main reason, however, is that I've developed something akin to an emotional bond with this film. Its brilliance lies in the way it manages to tell the story of a very personal tragedy while always focusing on, and never diluting, the epic tragedy that was the Titanic. And the moment where it never fails to touch a chord (relax, it's not the moment of Jack's death ¬ñ I'm not even that clich√©d) is when the now rather old and spotty Rose tells her listeners, 'I don't even have a picture of him; he exists now, only in my memory¬Ö' A simple, yet beautiful and poignant moment, one that we can all relate with, especially for those among us who particularly cherish their memories, whatever they be. Memories always leave a mark (and sometimes they leave behind scars), such that, ever so often, a single instance can stay with us for an entire lifetime. Memories shape us, mould us, and are an integral part in the development and continued growth of what is known as an emotionally intelligent being. They truly are the human part within us animals.Titanic then, is really quite a reflection of the true power of Human Memory.",9/10
Same Old Story,Sub-atomic,18 November 2000,"Folks, I'd just like to point a couple of thing out to you.  There is an art to movie-making.  Part of that art involves developing a story-line. Unless it is a satire, or otherwise involves a comment on an existing story-line, a good movie will have an original story line.  Titanic was a romance with a story that has been told before, too many times to count.  The inaccessible girl, the boy who must overcome the odds, including a better-placed suitor, to get the girl.  Such a lack of imagination makes for a bad movie. Titanic was an unimaginative story with a very large budget.There is an art to marketing.  To market something, you appeal to people's emotional centres.  One of the best way to do this is to apply the tried and tested formula of the human courtship ritual.  Gets 'em every time (if you spend enough money).Titanic was an extremely good marketing exercise.  However, many people who don't know better, got good marketing confused with good movie making.  Let me make this clearer for you.  Titanic was a good marketing exercise. Titanic was also a bad movie.",3/10

The very greatest best movie in the whole wide universe every made by James Cameron,pingshar,30 April 2012,"This is my absolute favorite movie of all time!! I loved how Cameron put a fictional story to have a tie-in with the real-life tragedy of the RMS Titanic sinking. .The acting from all those in it is superb. Billy Zane plays Cal brilliantly, Leo Di Caprio is one of the greatest actors in the world, and who better to play rose than Kate Winslet!? All in all this film is a must see, again and again and again!! I watch Titanic at least once a week, and twice on Sunday. Titanic never ceases to amaaaaze!!!You say there are other good movies out there!? I don't think so!!! Some people like Lawrence of Arabia, but I think it is far too dry. Who wants to watch a movie set in a desert!? It would have been much better if they had attacked Damascus from the sea!! Pass the beer!I liked the burning of Atlanta in Gone With the Wind, and the score was pretty good, but there were no words. What this film needs is a theme song. And a HOT love scene!! This is a romance, Margaret!!!Now Casablanca is a film with a good theme song. But there's not much of a plot. Can anyone remember the point of this movie!? It just meanders along like no one knew what the ending was going to be.What's with that long bus ride in It Happened One Night? And then all we get to see is Clark Gable taking off his shirt? Boring!!All The President's Men has some strong performances by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, but the guy who plays Richard Nixon doesn't look anything like him. The President was kind, the President was understanding, and the President was smart, too smart to get caught up bugging the Democrat Headquarters. Totally unbelievable storyline!! The Wizard of Oz has some nice singing by Judy Garland, but the CGI is pretty weak. Those muchkins don't look realistic, at all!! My Fair Lady has some good music, but the sets and costumes are pretty pathetic. Didn't look like London, at all. Looked more like Disneyland.Rebecca has a pretty good plot and a nice fire. But they seemed to have left out one little tiny detail. What was the name of his second wife?! Sloppy writing, Daphne!!North Buy Northwest has some amusing chase scenes and some clever dialog, but it is soooo predictable. Totally lacking in suspense.OK, Psycho has some suspense, even if it is short on dialog, but it is so flat. Now this is a film that needs to be redone in 3D!! Das Boot is long and boring. Sure, it is realistic, and life aboard a submarine IS boring. But it needs some excitement. Maybe they could steal an Enigma machine back from the British, or discover an underwater Atlantis or hit an iceberg or something, anything, to relieve the monotony. I know! Maybe they could dive through a wormhole and accidentally shoot a torpedo into the Titanic, or better yet, the Californian!! So there you have it. Titanic is without doubt the greatest masterpiece of cinema ever made. Period!!!!",10/10
good but not the best,braco,2 August 1998,"Comments like ""this is the best film I've ever seen"" etc... are very often heard but I think that such opinions are very shallow as is this love story about Winslet and Di Caprio. People who say that this is the best movie they''ve ever seen can't have been seen lots of movies. ""Titanic"" has great special effects but the story itself is very predictible and the characters are very vague and undefined and they don't develop at all during the film. Characters don't live through the movie. The best film of the 1997 is of course ""L.A. Confidential"" and it is shame that it didn't get more Oscars. But that's life. Experience says that most oftenly the best movies of a year don't get so many Oscars.",5/10
A shameful exploitation of an infamous tragedy . . .,Gatorman9,23 May 2023,"No amount of filmmaking technique (alleged filmmaking technique, anyway) can make up for the way this movie, part publicity stunt, part soap opera, part grade-B teen romance, so extravagantly disrespects the tragedy the memory of which it abuses here. Like the vast majority of TITANIC movies ever made, it posits a fundamentally silly interpersonal drama against one the most horrific historical disasters of modern times. Like the vast majority of TITANIC movies ever made, it is eminently forgettable. Instead of an evocative and fitting tribute to the subject matter, we are subjected to a lot of ridiculous cliches, adolescent actors, and even geeky nerd humor, entirely and utterly inappropriate to the gravity of the core event. Under the circumstances, I felt it difficult to award it as many as the four of ten stars I condescended to give it here in reflection of whatever purely technical merits it might have.If you want to see the movie that gives the telling of this catastrophe the justice it deserves, screen the Rank Organization's *A NIGHT TO REMEMBER* (1958), personally recommended - repeatedly - by no less a critic than real-life TITANIC survivor Eva Hart, recipient of an MBE from Queen Elizabeth for her contributions to recounting and memorializing the disaster.",4/10

Could have been better.,claybo76,31 December 1998,"I have to admit that the sinking of Titanic is done extremely well.  It is terrifying to watch, and probably the closest to the real thing we will ever see.  Amazing special effects as well as realistic direction of all the extras.  You could see that every person aboard was scared.  It was very clever to show us earlier in the film how the Titanic sank, from the computerised sinking shown to old Rose, so you knew it would break in half, and how it would go down, etc.  I felt that added another sense of tension.The love story that underlined the movie was what disappointed me.  This kind of terrible scripting and love-you-till-the-end-of-time encounters is now seeping into other movies, eg: Armageddon.  Does anybody honestly think a 'proper' girl in 1912 would indulge in spitting lessons?  Or pull the finger at Hockley's 'henchman' whilst going down the elevator?  Or make love in the back of a car with someone she has only known since being aboard the Titanic?The sketching scene is the only love scene needed.  It is showing us that Rose is starting to come out of her shell and rebel, although it is a private moment.  There is an unspoken intimacy between Rose and Jack that is beautiful, and expresses their love for each other better than a hand pressing against a steam covered car window.  I'm sure that scene made many a man wish he could draw his girlfriend/fiancee/wife.On the whole, parts of the film make me twinge, that bloody song, f'rinstance.  As well as blatantly obvious computer generated shots and terrible scripting (notice it didn't get a nomination for Best Original Screenplay? - it has been years since a film that won Best Film was nominated for that award). The effects are brilliant, along with the editing and the action sequences.",6/10
"Sink into the Romance: Titanic, a Masterpiece of Epic Proportions",izammohammed,14 April 2023,"If you're a fan of sweeping romance, breathtaking visuals, and stunning performances, then Titanic is the movie for you. This epic masterpiece directed by James Cameron is a timeless classic that has captured the hearts of audiences worldwide.From the moment the film begins, you're transported to a different era, an era of opulence and glamour, of wealth and poverty, of love and loss. The story follows the journey of Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet), two young lovers from different social classes who fall in love on board the doomed ship.The chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet is electric, their love story is the beating heart of the film. The tension and emotion they bring to their roles are palpable, and you can't help but be swept away by their romance. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Billy Zane as Rose's arrogant fianc√© and Kathy Bates as the unsinkable Molly Brown.But it's not just the performances that make this film so incredible. The attention to detail is remarkable, from the costumes and sets to the special effects and music. The recreation of the ship and its sinking is truly awe-inspiring, and the haunting score by James Horner perfectly captures the tragedy and beauty of the story.Overall, Titanic is a cinematic masterpiece that will leave you breathless. It's a film that transports you to another time and place and reminds you of the power of love in the face of tragedy. So if you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and sink into the romance of Titanic.",10/10
It shouldn't take 11 Oscars !,david_popa,19 July 2000,"Titanic i a good interesting movie with not such a good script but with a good direction. I saw it six times ! It get 11 Oscars by luck because there wasn't any good movies in '98. In my opinon it shouldn't take 11 Oscars. The actors didn't play so good . It is a good movie just because they invest so much in it and it is so long. If it wouldn't ""eat"" so much many, Titanic would be a BAD movie !!",7/10

The movie focuses way to much on a cheesy love story that is extremely pointless, I mean, if the dude dies, why the flip would they make a freaking 3 hour movie about making sexual pictures and extremely slow story, and then... he drowns after she says, ""I'll never let go, Jack, so here, I'll just let your body go into the cold depths,"" DOES THAT REALLY FREAKING MAKE SINCE AT ALL?!

"Looks great, horribly clich√©d plot",jmzkeenan,19 March 2009,"It's interesting to see the extreme opinions (pro or con) expressed here about Titanic, ranging from those who feel it's the greatest story ever told to those who feel it's the worst travesty ever produced in Hollywood. I don't agree with either ‚Äì I feel that Titanic is a somewhat run-of-the-mill movie that wasn't worthy of the vast amount of hype it generated, but can still provide an evenings entertainment (albeit with some employment of the fast forward button). I can supplement my review with contemporary impressions from first seeing the movie in 1998, taken from an email cum movie review written to a friend of mine in a distant corner of the world who hadn't seen the movie yet. (Extracts from this email are in quotes).First, the good stuff. I loved the efforts that Cameron made (either through sets, or through CGI) to reproduce the look of the RMS Titanic, as well as re-enacting the sinking:""Verdict on Titanic: The staging of the ships interiors and exteriors are stunningly realistic -- damn near perfect is more like it. Obviously, a great deal of effort was made to get things down pat."" It was also very interesting to see the underwater film that Cameron really shot on the wreck of the Titanic ‚Äì much better than the film shot for the Imax documentary Titanica. This underwater film, the interiors, and the digital depictions of the Titanic underway are enough to make the film worth watching all by itself.Regrettably, with the good comes the bad. I've always felt that the biggest strike against the movie is the clich√© love story between the two star-crossed lovers:""Unfortunately, a good chunk of the film is the so-called 'love story'. This portion of the story, starring this year's pretty boy, is Hollywood clich√© from start to finish. 'Poor little rich girl' meets poor but honest travelers/artist aboard the Titanic. She's travelling in 1st class with her beastly fianc√©e and assorted evil, stuck up, snobbish, rich capitalist/oligarch pigs. He's travelling 3rd class with the salt of the earth immigrants. Think for a few minutes and write up a list of 10 Hollywood clich√©s that come to mind. I guarantee that 75% of them are in the film.The real story of the Titanic and its passengers is story enough, in my opinion -- the love story wasn't needed. I assume that it was added to add some uncertainty to the story. Hollywood should have learned from Apollo 13 that just because the audience knows the end of the story doesn't mean you can't make a good movie of it. In any case, the 'love story' adheres so much to clich√© that it can be mapped out with uncanny accuracy after ~ five minutes anyway.""The only thing I would retract from my 1998 email is the comment about DiCaprio being ""¬Öthis year's pretty boy"" ‚Äì I've subsequently seen some of his other work, and I think that he can be a decent actor. I actually own Titanic on DVD (purchased cheap), and I watch it occasionally. But I do so with ample use of the fast forward button. I've sometimes wondered what someone could do with a ""Phantom Edit"" of Titanic ‚Äì could they edit Jack and Rose out of the film almost entirely, and just leave a decent semi-documentary account of the sinking?",5/10

"3D or not, go re-live this magnum opus all over again!",sasikanth20,10 April 2012,"Now how does one rate a classic like Titanic?? I was 11 years old when the movie first released and I still remember the first time I went to watch it. I barely had any knowledge about movies back then, but the sheer grandeur and brilliance of this movie made me watch it a billion times over and over!! (Twice in the last five days in 3D!!)After working on action classics like The Terminator, Rambo, Aliens and True Lies, James Cameron comes up with one of the best romantic, epic movies of all times. The way he adds fiction to the true story is absolutely brilliant. The script is too long, dialogues a little cheesy, screenplay a tad slow, but the whole package together is so beautiful that you end up falling in love with the movie. Bottom line, I'm no one to talk about this man.Twenty-two year old Kate Winslet looks gorgeous as Rose DeWitt Bukate, and plays her role to perfection. Her performance in the climax is so bloody haunting that I have goosebumps even now thinking about it. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal as Jack Dawson is one of his best works to date. The chemistry between them is probably the finest you will ever see on-screen. The rest of the cast, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, and every other actor, is excellent. It's a shame that it didn't win any Oscars for acting!Cinematography by Russell Carpenter is absolutely splendid. The way he captured the romantic moments between Rose and Jack in the first half, and the disastrous sinking in the later half is terrific. It is one of the best work on cinematography I've seen to date. Editing by James Cameron, Conrad Buff IV and Richard A. Harris is perfect. Music by James Horner is absolutely brilliant. Be it the foot tapping Irish music for the real party under-decks, the musicians playing till the last-minute before the sink, or the ever loved ""My Heart Will Go On"", master- pieces!!James Cameron spent over a year with 300 people to digitally remaster the 1997 version into 3D.

"Undoubtedly the best movie of the century! A triumph, in all aspects!",Anurag-Shetty,19 April 2012,"Titanic, is a fictional take on the tragic maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic. The events of the ill fated journey of the ship is told in the midst of a beautiful love story between two people of differing social backgrounds & how they overcome all odds to be together. Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCaprio), is a man who boarded the Titanic by chance. It was a gamble which had a third class ticket to the Titanic at stake. Rose DeWitt Bukater(Kate Winslet) is a woman of the royal family. She is one of the first few people who got a first class ticket for the very first voyage of the Titanic, along with other famous, wealthy & important people. So it was fate & fate alone, that brought Jack & Rose together. This is the synopsis of the movie.This is my review of the new 3D version of Titanic that released in 2012. First off, what a beautiful story. Sure, it's predictable, but, the way in which it's written ensures that you don't get bored even for a single second. The way that Jack & Rose fall in love is one of the highlights of the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio & Kate Winslet share great chemistry together. Not to mention, that they've acted brilliantly! Both Oscar worthy performances. Unfortunately, only Kate Winslet won the award for best actress. The supporting characters are impressive as well. The way they've shown how the ship first hits the iceberg, starts flooding, tilts at a 180 degree angle & finally snaps into two makes the movie. All this looks even better in 3D! The best conversion from 2D to 3D ever! So, grab your 3D glasses, popcorn & soft drink & be prepared to witness a once in a lifetime experience all over again! James Cameron, take a bow! A must watch!",10/10
A masterpiece,jhaggardjr,5 April 2000,"James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is a masterpiece. This is a brilliant film from start to finish. It's exciting, romantic, and never boring. I'm usually not a fan of movies that run over 3 hours long, but this is arguably my favorite 3 hour plus movie because it goes by fast. A year before this movie came out, CBS aired their two-part movie based on the 1912 sinking of the ship that was dubbed ""unsinkable"". It was O.K., but the 1997 theatrical film made the TV version look real flat by comparison. I've always had a fascination with the Titanic disaster, and this movie presents its depiction of the doomed ship in a frightening way. When I saw this movie the first time, at times I felt like I was on the Titanic. It's that good. Splendid acting, remarkable special effects, and masterful storytelling, this is a movie that I'll never forget.**** (out of four)",10/10

"A Classic, Sweeping Love Story",starry-eyed_wanderer,5 April 2005,"I fell in love with this movie instantly after viewing it for the first time. Many people ridicule this film for its idealistic and often 'mushy' romance, and for the lovers' passionate relationship after being acquainted for no more than two days. Of course, perhaps 'Titanic' isn't the most believable story of all time, but in my eyes it's certainly one of the most entertaining. I don't watch movies to see reality, I see enough of that every day. If reality is what I had been hoping for when viewing 'Titanic', I would have been sorely disappointed in the love story (despite it's breathtakingly accurate portrayal of the ship's infamous death).No, 'Titanic' is more of a fairytale, one that sweeps you away and holds your attention until it's ending. It is the unforgettable tale of Jack, a poor but kind-hearted street urchin, and Rose, a wealthy but misunderstood young woman. When fate brings them together on the first and last voyage of the Titanic, they must face many trials and tribulations in order to pursue their forbidden love. Keeping them apart is Rose's mother, who insists that her daughter marry a stuck-up rich man, and Cal, Rose's malicious fianc√© to whom she is to be wedded by force. While Jack and Rose are willing to face these odds for each other, there are some things which cannot be faced down, one of them being an iceberg, the ultimate destruction of their relationship.Despite its joyous fairytale like aspects, it is still very tragic. A feel-good romance and a tragic epic all in one, like a brilliant cross between 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Cinderella'. For the first half of the movie I was overwhelmed with a wonderful feeling. For the second half I was near tears. Finally, the movie's amazing conclusion was sending chills down my spine, and I felt as if I couldn't decide if I was happy or sad.Leanardo DiCaprio is mischievous yet sweet-natured as Jack, and masterfully brings across what is, in my opinion, the most memorable and lovable role in the entire film. I found Kate Winslet almost, yet not quite, as impressive as DiCaprio in her role as Rose, who although seeming perfectly content and fortunate outwardly is misunderstood and desperately miserable inside. Jack sees this hidden part of her, recognizing her longing for freedom and helps her to fulfill it. The remaining cast shines as well.Watch this movie. Enjoy it. Forget the real world, and lose yourself in 'Titanic'.",10/10

The script is kinda cheesy, but it fits Cameron's glamorous direction perfectly. Some of the best production design ever. Winslet's best, and her only great, performance.

The Best Movie that I have ever seen,farishthas,9 February 2014,"I am 24, I watched Titanic for the first time with my mother at the tender age of 7 years old... no cause for alarm, we were taught to close our eyes in age restricted scenes, which I did (technically).Titanic is the best movie that I have ever seen, I have probably seen it about 500 times since it was first released and I aim to see it once a year at least till I die. The glorious tale of tragic love upon the maiden voyage of a doomed luxury liner. Every time I see Titanic, I see it in a new light, I notice something different that I never noticed before and I cry all over again.The beauty of a movie like this is that it has the ability to cripple the strongest of men with emotion. Being a skeptic on love myself, I have to say that I am slightly glad at Jack's demise not because he's a bad character (in fact he's my favorite character) but because there is some realism to that aspect of the story. Up until the doom of Titanic sets in, it's all very Romeo and Juliet, the obsessed illusion of true love after barely days of knowing each other, at least Rose is hesitant of it at first, whereas Jack is smitten beyond comprehension... Alas, their supposed true love does not overcome the wrath of a very angry looking iceberg and of course Ismay's blatant challenge to God and all elements of an unsinkable ship. That being said we all know the fate of Titanic but this is not what makes this movie so wonderful... it is actually the integration of all characters, both little and large, whether it be the distraught Murdock, the grief stricken captain EJ or the delightfully despicable Hockley... they all merge together in a beautiful picture.. while the main characters and those closest to them were made up and given a slightly mediocre presence, it all fits in so well, tragedy, love, jealousy, arrogance, greed, honor, dedication and lust all get together to dance upon the ship of dreams.Whether you're male or female I'm pretty sure the ""I want you to draw me like one of your french girls"" scene was a tasty reminder at how erotic cinema can be without actual sex. sensuality at it's tender best but not my favorite scene in the movie... the most notable scene for me in Titanic was when the poorer passengers accepted their fate of death, the Irish mother and her kids, the old couple that embrace as water floods around their bed... those were scenes dripping with emotion... My favorite scene however, is when Rose joins Jack below decks to party with the third class folk... just goes to show that money does not make-th the man, a good heart does.The marvel of the ship in all it's grandeur made me realize that Mister James Cameron is a visionary, the attention to detail of a simple thing like cutlery was admirable. Shining performances did not come from Dicaprio and Winslet as some foolish viewers believe the shining performers were Kathy Bates, Billy Zane,Frances Fisher and Gloria Stuart.I can go on about what a brilliant movie this is but I should not.End note, excellent movie that every person should see at least once before they die.",10/10
"Technically brilliant, let down by the actors",growe,24 October 1999,"I resisted all the hype at the time this film came out, and managed to wait until it appeared on TV before seeing it for the first time. It was a profoundly impressive film, but only in certain respects. The plot was thin and predictable (well, I suppose in a film named 'Titanic', the plot pretty well *has* to be predictable), and the acting was fairly mediocre. I guess what I found so impressive was just the overwhelmingly good job that was done on making you feel like you were right there. Everything from the simulated aerial shots of the ship at the beginning of the film, right through to the close ups of events during the disaster itself is done so well that you can immerse yourself (if you'll pardon the joke) in the experience.It is just a pity that the acting from most of the performers didn't rise to the occasion. It is easy to see why none of the film's 11 Oscars was for acting. I suppose I'm a bit biased because I personally cannot stand DiCaprio, who can't act to save his soul, but I found the other performances to be less than the film really needed.Overall, though, the impressive technical achievement in bringing Titanic to the screen outweighs the human shortcomings, giving the film a rating of 7/10.",7/10
Great Looking Film but ultimately flawed,Maestro-15,28 March 1999,"I like millions rushed to see this overhyped film when it opened and what it did was just confirm what Hollywood does to true life events for decades. Overdramatization and inaccurate storytelling of real events. For those who are really interested in how events actually unfolded on the doomed steamer, go run and see the 1958 film ""A Night to Remember"". I kept comparing the story of that film to this one and kept asking myself how can it be so different and omit so many scenes as to why the ship went down the way she did? But then again, James Cameron's script went for the old formula love story with class discrimination thrown in with a jealous fiancee. Does it entertain the moviegoer - it does...the film does an incredible job of recreating the feeling that you were there through the finest details, costumes, sets, special effects etc... But the most important thing to note here is that with the sinking of Titanic came the end of the ""gilded"" age and with the release of this film, it will probably close the 20th century as the highest grossing film of our era. Finally, this film should not be on anyone's best list.",No Rating
üëçüèª,rodionbbb,19 January 2022,"The actors were very well chosen and did a great job in their roles! The beginning of the 20th century, the distinction between classes, the lower class and the aristocracy, which a priori cannot be together, is perfectly removed, but love knows no boundaries. The whole atmosphere of the film conveys the real feelings that people experienced on the real Titanic - panic, pain, the desire to survive, the realization that this is not an illusion, but a reality! The beauty of the ocean and the ship, inside which the stories of thousands of lives take place, is very mesmerizing. Immersion in the film occurs immediately, instantly. The acting keeps you in suspense until the end of the film!",9/10

It's not a timeless classic; it's dumbed-down faux romance in the midst of tragedy drivel. Spend money on the script, not the special effects, for God's sake!

Phenomenal success,DemurraNasty,19 January 2022,"According to the press, Cameron got the idea for the picture after watching a documentary by James Ballard from the National Geographic series, filmed in 1987 and telling about a trip to a liner resting on the ocean floor. However, before the realization of the idea, the eminent director-screenwriter created not only the ""Abyss"", where the action takes place under water, but also the expensive futuristic action movie ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", only after that he managed to convince the management of two majors, 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures, to agree to mind-blowing costs (eventually the budget was a record $ 200 million), which predicted a grand catastrophe in advance. But Cameron still did not back down and, moreover, remained faithful to the initially chosen course: that is why the main action is framed in ""Titanic"" by a prologue and an epilogue telling about a group of researchers trying to find out at least some details of the crash. However, the secret of the phenomenal success of the film without exaggeration around the world (the total box office totaled over $ 1.8 billion, of which only $ 600 million was in North America) lies in something else. Unlike the creators of almost all previous versions, Cameron outlined the story taking into account the rather strict requirements of what is commonly called - certainly with capital letters! - Big Hollywood Style. His brainchild can be considered a contribution of overseas cinematographers of the end of the XX century to that glorious tradition, with which, first of all, the products of the ""factory of stars"" were associated in the minds of the mass audience throughout the century. ""Titanic"" fits perfectly into the typological series, including such names as ""The Birth of a Nation"", ""Ben Hur"" (even two versions, the 20s and 50s), ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""The Sound of Music"". On the one hand, the story is again based on a genuine event - and a significant, even fateful event. The author not only reproduces the circumstances of the tragedy in the most detailed way, but interprets it in a symbolic way as an ominous warning to humanity - a warning about those global cataclysms of a political, social, man-made and natural nature that soon hit the Earth. The dramatically increased possibilities of cinema allowed the audience to assess the true scale of what happened, to feel to the depths of the soul and clearly see what the iron tread of History is. However, on the other hand, making a reservation just in case, the director-screenwriter introduces a fictional character (Cameron insisted on the candidacy of DiCaprio, then little-known), who turns out to be the main character of the entire romantic line, where fantasy, again according to custom, is not at all obliged to obey the facts. ""Titanic"", therefore, does not seem to be an innovative work, which, perhaps, it did not pretend to be. But Cameron cannot but be grateful for the contribution that he has made to the growth of the popularity of cinema all over the planet.",10/10
who hasn't seen this movie,luckyfoshizzle,8 April 2007,"I don't think I have ever come across someone that hasn't seen this movie. Whether you loved it or hated it you at least saw it. The amount of money this movie made speaks for just how good it was. People say this movie is overrated, but I don't think so. I think this movie is the perfect example of everything a movie should have: romance, drama, history, tragedy, and amazing effects.The directing was great! I really began to feel like I was a part of this movie. The acting was great. I really bought Kate's performance in being a ""poor little rich girl"" and Leonardo's performance in being the ""poor free spirit"", everyone did a good job. I love movies about things that have happened in the past and out of all the movies I've seen I believe this movie was the most accurate account of what occurred on the Titanic (except with the whole love thing).The plot line is great. It was a great idea to put the romance in because that drew in women, the history drew in older people, and the effects drew in the guys. To me, I think everything was great. This movie had so much feeling and if you didn't cry at least a little at the end, you must have no heart. And if you haven't seen this movie, you are defiantly missing out.",10/10
Fabulous!,de_niro_2001,20 January 2007,"I can't understand why this film has come high in polls for the worst ever film. It is very well made and won 11 Oscars. It is far better than the old films about the disaster. The acting is excellent and the effects take your breath away. It wouldn't have been any more realistic if James Cameron had commissioned a shipyard to build a full-scale working replica of the ship. The film is very authentic with just one minor lapse, namely the American locomotive and rolling stock on the dockside railway seen in front of the Titanic in the view from the pub. Unlike previous films about the Titanic there is no sense of impending doom throughout the film. There is a good feeling in the first half of the film, with scenes like Jack and Fabrizio at the bow watching the dolphins while Captain Smith looks on paternalistically and the ceilidh in steerage that Jack takes Rose to. James Cameron conveys the sheer size and stability of the ship very well and the audience is drawn into the very deep security that the passengers felt. Everybody on board is very friendly apart from certain individuals in First Class. Cal Hockley is a violent overgrown spoiled brat monster child. In a lot of scenes, particularly where he shoots at Jack with a handgun, he is reminiscent of the caddish upper class villain in a silent film. Jack has been criticised for being too 1990s but the rest of the cast look and act right for the period. The crew talk authentic sounding Edwardian English. James Cameron has caught the feel of the period very well and he has said that the people in the film are in many ways not that different from us today. It's fair to say that Jack and Fabrizio are like a couple of gap year students hitch-hiking round the world. Kate Winslet, with her full curvy figure which has got her a lot of period roles and the nickname ""Corset Kate"" is spot on as Rose. The scene where Jack sketches her nude is very touching and the piano music that accompanies it is lovely. When they run past the stokers one can feel the scorching heat of the furnaces. After the ship strikes the iceberg the audience has much the same incredulity as the passengers and most of the crew that there is a possibility of the ship sinking. The sinking, as it was in real life, starts very gradually and becomes progressively more terrifying. Although there is no blood or gore shown it still is horrifying. The only blood during the sinking are the scenes where the stewards get punched. There are some really sad scenes during the sinking such as the drowned woman floating in the water and the Irish mother telling her children the old Celtic story of Ossian and Niamh. It is sad when Fabrizio is killed by the collapsing funnel and when Tommy Ryan is shot by First Officer Murdoch in the heat of the moment. Incidentally, 20th Century Fox sent one of their executives over to Scotland to apologise to the people of Dalbeattie, Murdoch's home town, about the way he was portrayed in the film. One really feels the freezing cold when Jack and Rose are in the water and I felt sad when I saw the dead baby in its mother's arms. When I saw the film in the cinema I can remember hearing a couple of girls crying during and after the sinking. James Cameron says he deliberately made the ending ambiguous and his answer to the question of whether Rose dies or is dreaming at the end is ""You decide"". I think she died and went to Heaven and was reunited with all these people she'd known on the ship. It is a beautiful scene where she's reunited in Jack and she's all in white like a bride. Hey! I'm going against my own principles. I'm one of the most unromantic guys in the world! I'm not supposed to like these scenes!",10/10
I loved this movie really much,yimalo,19 January 2022,"There are a few silly plot conveniences in the film, but they are quickly overshadowed by the spectacle and powerful acting work that ""Titanic"" brings with it. This classic film has revolutionary CGI for its time, and the classic story of star-crossed lovers is beautifully transferred to ""Titanic."" This film remains one of Cameron's best works ever to hit the big screen. The plot is well crafted and the romantic relationships, while questionable, still make sense. Overall, a great movie that really conveys the horror of what happened on the Titanic, providing a few tear-inducing moments, especially at the end.",9/10
"15 minutes into the film, I prayed to the heavens everyone of them would just drown and be done with it!!",captain solo,21 March 2002,"When I was a child I cried, bitterly, when the fat lady (Shelley Winters) bravely dived into the waters in the truly epic 'Poseidon Adventure'. Why? Because the screen playwright and director understood that true human glory is not about special effects, but characterisation.I can't begin to recount the superficiality and shallowness of this dreadful film - where there's absolutely no foundation for genuine affection, much less enduring love. And, worst of all, with his very inapt hands, James Cameron attempted to repeat the cliche of rich girl meets poor boy, which bears no significance whatsoever to the plot(if it can be called one), in which everybody was subject to a violent death, nobleman or peasant.The art of tragedy is a tricky one, but there is one simple rule - make your characters genuine, realistic, and most of all believable, so that the audience will feel what they feel, breathe what they breathe and, in the end, partake in the experience.",1/10
"Great effects, but not enough to save Titanic from mediocrity.",mjurado,25 June 2002,"By now everyone has seen this film, so there's no need to give details. You've heard all the pre-teen girls and middle-aged housewives rave about it. Now, here are thoughts on this film from a male. I don't have a vendetta against this film. Except being dragged to it twice and being forced to see it again on video. Oh, the humanity. OK, maybe I do have a small vendetta.Titanic is visually impressive. SFX are impressive as well. It's really sort of neat to see the whole incident re-created on film. As for the story, Titanic is at the same time a self-important and impossibly simplistic film. Characterization in Titanic seems to be done with a very large club; the dialogue in the same fashion. Don't expect any subtleties here. What you hear from the characters is exactly what is going on. It's pretty much a paint-by-number love/tragedy, and unless you're especially sappy, the dialogue is likely to range from flat and predictable to downright appalling. It reminded me of watching a couple at a junior high dance call each other ""pooky"" or something.The old woman at the start and finish of the film is a bunch of boring nonsense. Why waste the viewers' time seeing the heroine as an elderly invalid? No one came to the theatre to see that. They could have at least made her accent match Winslet's.You know the drill, the princess falls in love with the pauper. I'm not totally opposed to the romance picture if it's done well, but this one simply is not. They call each other by name in every sentence. Very annoying. A romance film is only as good as the dialogue and the scenes where you see it all come together. Sorry, but teaching a girl to spit before having her pose nude for pictures isn't really my idea of romance.It's also very clear what Cameron wants you to think. Except for Jack and Rose, every poor person has a heart of gold, and every rich person on the boat is evil and deserves to be, well, drowned like a rat. The passengers are stereotyped so badly the ""rich people being snobs"" scenes will likely leave you rolling your eyes. OK, they are bad rich people, and poor people are basically good. We GET it already.I find it puzzling that so much time was obviously spent on the effects, (which were, to be fair, excellent) and yet we get such a basic script that this basically becomes a thinly-disguised, well-targeted effects movie. Effects are great, but can't salvage a poor, eccentric script and below-average performances from its actors.Not much was made about the length of this picture, but I found it to be excruciating. It boggles the mind how Cameron could write the most simplistic script ever, and stretch it out to be so long that you start hoping the !@* damn !@(&$& boat would just sink already!Ahem.Cameron is great - at directing a visual picture. But don't expect him to write a masterpiece. Effects are great, but this film is far, far too long for a script with all the complexity of a coloring book. Visually stunning, Titanic is; no doubt about that. But when it comes to substance, Titanic is all wet.",1/10
"A pretty well done action film, but gets awkwardly drawn out toward the end.",gagewyn,11 December 2000,"The sets and costumes for this movie were good, other than that it was OK but really drawn out and at least 45 minutes too long to keep from being tedious.  The characters have the beginnings of something.  The girl is a trapped feminist character, but I got the idea that her character was more to be politically correct.  As for the conflict between classes as the passengers struggle to get positions on life rafts leaving the sinking ship, this is set up as a little too black and white.  This is all acceptable for a simple action film, which tend to have cardboard characters to a certain extent.	The film is a pretty good little perils of pauline serialized style action film.  The acting is pretty good.  The dialogue is OK.  The main flaw is that it went on to long and played itself out.  I got extremely bored at the point when Rose√ïs future husband decides to chase Jack and Rose into the boat with a gun.  What√ïs the point?  The audience already knows that he√ïs a bad guy.  After this many of the scenes get repeated.  Third class passengers beat at the doors to the deck as the water rises - again.  Jack has to swim underwater and get the keys - again.  The repeat action sequences only stop once the ship actually sinks.  I think that had it not been for this extra 45 minutes I would have liked the film.  If you are watching this on video and it bothers you then my advice is to fast forward.	I don√ït recommend this film.  Other than the pretty sets and packaging its a typical explosions film.  Except, here when the man puts his arm around the woman to protect her as they run down the hallway with a fireball of a violent explosion, they aren√ït running from a fire ball, instead they are running from a big burst of water.",No Rating

To me, this movie is pure eye-candy.  It's beautiful, simply amazing to look at, and if you're deaf--it might be a good film.  Everyone in the cast is a fantastic actor/actress.  But Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet turn in the WORST performances of their careers.  I watched them in embarassment. A bad car accident on film (actually a boat disaster).That's not to say the film lacks any emotion.  I felt for everyone on the ship except Jack and Rose.  What really makes my stomach turn is the entire cast and crew not minding that this is a fictional story set in historic facts.  It's rearranging history and I do hope future generations don't see it this way.  If you liked Disney's Pocahontas or any other film playing off historic events, then you might enjoy this.  I'm not saying this couldn't have happened, but I would have preferred that they would have said up front, on the cover or box or poster that this movie is 95% fiction: Yes there was a boat named Titanic, and it did in fact sink.I wonder if the survivors thought the movie was good or accurate (or if any of  them saw it at all).  Were their feelings hurt that such a horrific event was made into a blockbuster love-story film and capitalized on relentlessly?  I honestly cringe thinking about the future real-life disaster films--will 9/11 be turned into a love story?

On the other hand, it is also a love story, which feels like Romeo and Juliet on a boat, but with social class struggles instead of family feuding. As a history movie, Titanic is a top-20 film, but as a love story it falls flat for me. Call me heartless, but this movie did not affect me.

This Movie Deserved Every Oscar It Got,KristinNAz,20 September 2004,"For the people on here who commented that Titanic was the ""worst movie they've ever seen,"" apparently they haven't seen ""Showgirls"" or anything with Anna Nicole SMith. Give me a break guys. James Cameron did a phenomenal job with this movie; it truly brought the Titanic disaster back to life. Mr. Cameron did hundreds of hours (if not thousands) of research on the Titanic, including getting the poignant footage under water of the ship. A lot of facts and history with the Titanic disaster was incorporated into this movie,, giving us all the more reason to love it. Though it was over 3 hours long, I was not bored for one minute and that's very unusual for me to be able to sit through a movie this long. I was captivated by the love story and suspense Mr. Cameron created. The theme song "" My Heart Will Go On"" was perfect for the movie but it was terribly over played on the radio stations during this time. The ending was magnificent and I think everyone in the theatre cried, knowing that almost 2,000 people perished in the end. Yes, there were a couple of corny lines in the movie but no movie is perfect. I think the special effects used while the ship was sinking and the passengers were loading up in the boats, was extremely realistic and just moving. The replica ship used was also incredible. I think both Kate Winslet and Leonardo DeCaprio were fantastic in the lead, though I think Ms. Winslet was a little miscast since she looks a lot older than Leo. I have seen this movie several times and still watch it when it's on television. I do not think any other Titanic movie is superior to this one. **** 1/2 stars out of 5.",No Rating
Great Special Effects Do Not A Good Movie Make,Freddy-12,23 March 1999,"Titanic features one of the worst screenplays ever perpetrated on the moviegoing public.

How can the Academy award it ""Best Picture"" when it didn't even receive a best screenplay award?  And when Kenneth Turan of the L.A.

It deserved the many things that it got. And some it did not deserve. The 11 oscars, all I can say is ""Congratulations Mr. Cameron, you are a genius."" The box office smash, good for you Titanic. But the repititious, boring and old hype for this movie went way too far. It wasn't as good as it was made out to be. For one, the whole teenybopper/Leonardo DiCaprio love craze lasted way too long. It was not an abnormal thing, one of those passing phases but was the sole of the HUGE amount of money it made.Now I saw this almost first in theaters, the weekend it came out. I saw it twice in theaters and maybe two or three times on video (which I own). I hadn't read any reviews for it, I loved it and cried. It had its share of flaws. A rather large share at that. The critics don't pick up on these sort of things. One thing I did not understand: How Kate Winslet picked up an Oscar nomination and Leonardo DiCaprio did not. Now I am not especially a fan of Mr. DiCaprio, I leave that to the girls. But he did just as good of a job as Ms. Winslet, if not better. The performances in the film were marvelous and spectacular, and Mr. DiCaprio's was exceptional.
This movie had too much of certain elements and too less of others. Of course everyone knows how the background story ends. The ship hits an iceberg and sinks. That is not a spoiler. Anyone living in North America and Europe should know at least an ample about of information about it. But the emotional, side-story about the love affair between a first-class, rich girl with everything and a low-class, poor guy with nothing. And of course what would a movie be without a bad guy. A ""villain"" of some sort. Billy Zane gives a great performance in this role, as usual. The kind of guy you love to hate and hate to love. But you always figure out a way to do both. Through the film you get to like Jack (DiCaprio) and Rose (Winslet) a lot more as their love affair continues. Through the first tape, it builds to the climaxes...let's just leave it to the famous car scene and the more famous drawing scene. The second tape, or the second half, things start to go downhill. The excitement is more ""blah"" and the suspense is still there but is predictable and gets quite silly and sappy. The dialouge towards the end is very silly and sounds very rehearsed.The movie would have been a lot better if it focused more on the ship itself, the iceberg, etc. and less on the emotional story. ""Titanic"" is an inappropriate title in this movie. This situation could have happened on an airplane, be given the name ""Southwest Airlines"" and wouldn't have been half good.Well my point is, I enjoyed this movie. It was great. Not excellent, but a great movie. Definitely will go down in history books, but not in mine. Not on my top ten, top twenty, maybe the top fifty. ****1/2 out of *****",No Rating
My favorite movie,InHong,28 September 2015,"The movie of Titanic came out in 1997. And then was an Oscar award winning. The director is James Cameron. And the actors is Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack and Kate Winslet as Rose. This movie is love story. The Titanic was a ship that sank in 1992. It reorganize show film. When play ""My heart will go on"" song that will impress the movie, and then the love feeling. 3 hours long time, and then my watching is very romantic every plots, what is follow next plot. For example, Rose was flying in ships beside, that audiences were touched my heart by this shot. And then the scenery of breaking dawn is beautiful and wonderful. Every girl want instead of Rose that is romantic plot. Second, the passengers confused around the ship after the Titan crashed iceberg, unless musicians played on ""Wedding Dance"" so quiet. The shot was satirized by this gimmick point.Discussing technology, the titanic used model ship, which have shoot really effect. The passengers fall down and slide on the floor after the titanic was sinking in the ocean. The technology is very amazing in 1997, that isn't easy play on video. So, the video is a big making that appreciate the director designing, and then the plot had a nervous environment.The movie is my favorite. Jack and Rose is excellent, and then bring me have a romantic feeling. It was complete the end from embark to accident, let's me watching Titanic event. I feeling that your life must have once watching ""Titanic"", you will understand what the movie is successful.Finally, no matter how watching again, the movie couldn't boring.",9/10
A Night to Remember at the Cinema,jason-210,26 January 2009,"Anyone who saw the old black & white movie ""A Night to Remember"" will appreciate the improved special effects in this one, but miss the more accurate portrayal of the historic event. James Cameron really managed to bring the old ship back to life for the big screen, but at the same time he strayed from history, painting a negative and inaccurate picture of the crew and passengers.I'm not referring to the fictitious love story between the two fictitious characters Kate and Jack. This addition is clearly pure invention, a device to involve the audience's emotions in the tragedy in a way that a documentary style film doesn't. That's fine. What's not fine to twist the historical facts about real people, which Cameron clearly does in this film. Many of the portrayals of the crew members are fictionalized. I suppose it's forgivable to make ordinary people into heroes, but to make heroes into villains, as this film does, is I think, unethical. It's damaging to the memory of those people, and I'm sure it's offensive to their surviving descendants.The biggest misrepresentation is of 1st Officer Murdoch, who is portrayed as losing his mind and shooting passengers and himself during the sinking during the evacuation. In reality Murdoch did not shoot passengers or himself. The writers of the film completely made this up. Captain Smith is portrayed as a weak, ineffectual human being incapable of making decisions. For me, Bernard Hill was wrongly cast in this role - he does not have the charisma and presence of Smith. According to most studies and records, Smith was also active until the very end. A one point he was calling back boats on his megaphone when he saw that they weren't full ‚Äì a scene that was edited out of the movie for the final release.I've always had mixed feelings about this film. The effects, sets, costumes and technical accuracy are impressive; as are some of the characters. I particularly like the chief engineer, and Murdoch; but there are aforementioned inaccuracies, and also many unnecessarily silly bits like the scene with Cal chasing Jack and Kate down the grand staircase with a gun, firing shots as he went, which cheapen the film.I think that, when you make a film like this, dealing with such a monumental tragedy, with characters representing real people in recent history, it's very shameful to invent bad things about them.But all in all this remains an epic film and was one of the most impressive films I'd ever seen at the cinema back when I first saw it in 1997.",6/10
An eternal classic,chegurisundeep,9 January 2019,"This film is something so beautiful and awe inspiring, at the same time stricking you with a meloncholic feel that leaves a dent on your heart for a long time to come. This film stays with you as long as you live and dream films",10/10
Love Never Dies,malikmusa-79423,3 March 2023,"The film's attention to detail and production design is simply breathtaking. The grandeur of the Titanic is expertly portrayed, and the film's recreation of the ship's interiors and exteriors is nothing short of stunning. The special effects and practical effects used to bring the ship to life are equally impressive, and the sinking of the ship is one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history.However, it is the performances of the lead actors that truly make Titanic a masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have incredible chemistry on screen, and their performances are emotionally charged and nuanced. Their portrayal of two people from different worlds who fall in love despite the odds is touching and heartbreaking.In addition to the romance, the film also features strong supporting performances from a talented ensemble cast that includes Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, and Frances Fisher.Titanic is a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences today. Its stunning visuals, expertly crafted story, and powerful performances make it a cinematic masterpiece that is sure to be remembered for generations to come. It is a film that should be seen by everyone, and its impact on cinema cannot be overstated.",No Rating
this is art,kuangzao,15 April 2020,"From the first time I watched this movie, I knew it was always gonna be one of my favorites.
From the beautiful direction and camera work and the music of choice to the amazing acting performed by Leo and Kate. It was a perfect choice to tell this story from a new but strong romance and love, giving the viewer a realization of how this must have been. When I watch this I feel happy, free and empowered but then scared for my own life just watching. It really gives you a picture of what it could have been like on the actual Titanic.

Hollywood at its best: should be in the top 100 movies ever made,andrewtowne-1,11 February 2009,"I loved this movie. It has everything -- romance, tragedy, comedy, suspense, action, adventure, acute social commentary -- and is extremely well crafted.Many movies try to do everything and fail. This movie tries to do everything and succeeds beautifully. Better than that, it is greater than the sum of its remarkable parts. And it is hard to get better than that.Those who are -- with I admit a lot of justification -- cynical about big Hollywood productions might not ever accept what I am saying. But being closed-minded is not the same as being clever. Not every low-budget ""art"" or independent film is great; neither is every big-budget production from Hollywood bad. ""Titanic"" not only isn't bad, I am confident that it will go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever made.Let's begin with Leonardo DiCaprio. He is in a class by himself as an extraordinarily good looking young man who is not just a pretty boy, but who can really act. He was riveting in ""The Basketball Diaries."" He is no less outstanding in ""Titanic."" I have never seen an actor showing such range -- from drug addicted athlete to romantic lead -- in such a short period of time. Clearly, the only thing that can hold DiCaprio back is a bad script. This leads me to my next key point: ""Titanic"" is very well written. There is not a single false note in the writing, and the plotting is very tight with no holes that I can see. It all fits neatly and plausibly together -- which is rare both in novels and in movies.I could go on, praising the other actors, the direction, the special effects, etc., but I think I've made my overall point. This is not just some over-blown pseudo-romance featuring depth-less and soul-less ""beautiful people."" It makes me proud that Americans can still create great art -- even in Hollywood.",10/10
"Titanic, redefining the word ""mediocre""",beezlebozo,25 April 2000,"Your average American loves Titanic. This is why they are considered average. This movie is unimpressive in every possible way. From the bland acting to the bland script this movie is, well, bland. The script, by the way, was co-written by James Cameron and the captain of the girl's tether-ball team from the local junior high school.The only extraordinary thing about this film is the special effects. A boat sinks. A really big boat. It looks really really real.           But it's still just a boat sinking. Not that exciting.All in all this is a movie geared towards illiterate 12 year old girls.",1/10
Beautiful masterpiece of cinematography,thaliawoodchipper,5 September 2023,"Are you looking for a movie that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster? Look no further than the 1997 blockbuster hit, Titanic. This epic romance-drama is a must-see for anyone who loves a good story.From the moment the film begins, you are transported back in time to the early 1900s. The attention to detail in the set design and costumes is impeccable, making you feel as though you are truly on board the Titanic. The film's director, James Cameron, spared no expense in creating a world that is both beautiful and tragic.The story follows the journey of Jack Dawson, a poor artist, and Rose DeWitt Bukater, a wealthy socialite. Despite their different backgrounds, the two fall deeply in love during the voyage. Their romance is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, as they face numerous obstacles throughout the film.One of the most impressive aspects of Titanic is the incredible performances by the cast. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have undeniable chemistry on screen, making their love story all the more believable. The supporting cast, including Billy Zane and Kathy Bates, also deliver standout performances.But Titanic is not just a love story. It is also a tale of tragedy and survival. The film's climax, when the Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to sink, is both thrilling and devastating. The special effects used to create the sinking ship are still impressive over 20 years later.Overall, Titanic is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. It is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and feel every emotion in between. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it as soon as possible. You won't regret it.",10/10

I think in the next 50 or 100 years, it's still a story that the toughest man will cry after watching.Everything in the movie makes sense and is really logical that it made me to suspend my disbelief. There are many camera angles and transitions which can speak and are really amazing, especially in 1990s.Once again, thank you very much for your masterpiece, James Cameron and your crew.",10/10
Dead in the water,sfbigguy43,9 April 2001,"An interviewer recently asked Woody Allen why he doesn't attend the Academy Awards presentation. ""Those people give Oscars to films like Titanic,"" he replied.Other than The Biggest Show on Earth, Titanic is probably the worst film ever to receive a best picture Oscar. Sure, a godzillion people went to see it and took in more money than do most small nations, but that doesn't mean it's good or even watchable. Independence Day and Wild, Wild West both made scads of money and both stunk to high heaven.The damn boat does not start to sink until an hour and a half into the movie and when it does, the film shifts to level of awfulness that is eclipsed only by the stunningly unbelievable slop that comprises its first half. What can you say about a picture that focuses obsessively on capturing the look of the ship's interior, the clothing of the passengers, even the dinnerware off of which the passengers eat, yet completely flubs the actual story of the sinking? James Cameron obviously did not believe that the loss at sea of the most famous ship of the 20th century presented an interesting enough story to modern (American), so he proceeded to distort the historical record with his own purely fictional dramatic flourishes. As huge water cannon hose down those expensive sets, he gooses up the drama by staging a gunfight in the first class lounge. This occurs after 1) Kate saves Leo from  certain drowning by applying an ax to the handcuffs that chain him to a water pipe (ironic, huh?) 2) the two jointly rescue an abandoned waif inexplicably separated from its momma 3) Kate tells her upper class snob boyfriend to stuff it because she'd prefer drowning with Leo to a seat next to him in a lifeboat.Very climatic.The film does provide some great camp moments, for example when Kate presents to her insensitive beast fiance a little bauble she's picked up in Montmartre, Picasso's The Desmoiselles d'Avignon (hey, didn't this go down with the ship?). And when the big vessel is about to slide into the freezing North Atlantic, Kate gets weepy and nostalgic as she hangs for dear life off the stern, ""Jack, this is where we first met!""The ending is ludicrous and not only because there are survivorsIf you want to view a GOOD movie about the Titanic, try A Night to Remember or even the Barbara Stanwyck version, both from the 1950's. Both made for less than 150 million bucks each, even adjusted for inflation. Imagine.

Memorable Film,QueenMakeda84,6 January 2005,"This film will go down in history as just a groundbreaking film, aside from anything else. When it came out, you wanted to see it. The way they advertised it, how could you not? We're all guilty of morbid curiosity and love the irony of a ship so grand in scale and deemed ""Unsinkable"" to so many could actually do the unthinkable and pretty much capsize. It fascinates all of us. James Cameron did an excellent job of pulling this together. They wasted a lot of water that some 3rd world countries could have used, but still a good job. I liked the flashback idea, but it's pretty obvious the chick woulda been dead in most real life circumstances and Kate Winslet doesn't play a convincing 17 year old girl.I liked the true ending of the ship. It actually went down in 2 pieces rather than in all one form as other versions have implied. It kinda makes this movie the definitive version in a way, because it broke the standard. The climax was for the men. To this day, all my boyfriend talks about is the guy hitting the propeller and spinning madly to his icy death. But, the love story was definitely for the women. It was a little pretentious to think that she would have followed this man in the 4 days that she knew him, but hey, that's Hollywood. Rose was a nice insert as a person in history, but it seems fairly fantastic today that this story would ever happen. Jack was a stupid twit of a man that had no prospects and we're supposed to believe that she would run away with this cat? Oooh, rich bastard who's hot or poor twit whose only appeal is that he lives under a bridge? Oh, the choices. His nomadic existence was suppose to charm us, but all I saw was a bum. And look what happened to him. He was supposed to be so used to cold water and whatnot and the boy froze like a fishstick. If I were her, I woulda went back to Cal and said, ""My bad about that spitting thing"".I loved the character of Mr. Andrews. A little stupid for wanting to die with his creation, but to each his own. I can't believe that people actually wanted to go down with the ship and kept playing music and whatnot. Absolutely saddening that they were missing the big picture. Ship sinking. Need to get off. I found the music inspiring and we'll always have Celine Dion's song to drag us back to 1997: the year it wouldn't stop playing. I never really felt the terror of being on this ship though. I found that people had plenty of opportunities to get off, but they were just too damn stuck up to try anything. Only the 3rd class folks you felt sorry for. They actually tried to keep them on the boat. You felt bad for them, because they were the ones that were gonna die, because of their low station. However, I didn't have sympathy for first class folks. And where were the 2nd class people? It was like they didn't exist. I guess they weren't instrumental to the plot, but I wouldn't have minded seeing them at times.And of course, we're all a little mad at the old lady dropping the necklace in the water. I know it's supposed to be poignant, but give it to the granddaughter or somebody. Brock should have gotten it. I felt bad for him because he was like the rabbit from the ""Trix"" commercials. Just let him have it for goodness sakes! He's only devoted his entire adult life to it. No, little old crackpot decides to toss it overboard. I woulda made her go in after it...anywho, good film over all. We'll all remember it when we're old as ""that"" film.",9/10
Titanic in 3D and AVX,onumbersix,6 April 2012,"Titanic in 3D. I had never seen this film before. Is that possible?

At the time of its release, I said to myself: Ah, just another love story and besides I know the ending. I must admit now, it's not so bad. Quite good in fact. Almost 3 and a half hours well spent. While watching, I had a thought for my Grand-father who, had he crossed over only 2 years later, might have very well gone down with the Titanic and I wouldn't be here to tell the story.

James Cameron worked a miracle with this film and truly deserves every bit of credit and more... there is almost nothing bad I can say about this film except for the fact that the whole ""chase and shoot whilst boat is sinking"" was a little bit too far fetched...but hey, it's only a film and it was still good entertainment.If you haven't seen the film, please ignore the hate buzz around and watch it, you will enjoy it....9/10",9/10

He simply played himself. He was magnificent in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but hasn't done anything since worth watching. He's simply a pretty-boy who cannot play this type of role.This film is filled with lots of good actors in pathetic roles. Kathy Bates is one of my favorites, but her character in this was horrible. It represented absolutely nothing, had no substance, and was completely fictional.Fictional...that's what this movie was. From the start, the ""foggy"" appearance of the movie, which was supposed to give you the illusion of the early teens, just made the movie look like poorly-drawn animation. This was obviously an attempt at making a classic. This is a recipe for disaster. Classics were never meant to be classics. They were meant to be movies. Try making a good movie, and it might become a classic. Try making a classic, and its lack of substance will cause it to break apart into tiny little pieces.The good thing about the movie was the final scene in the water.

He did countless retakes of key scenes, got behind the camera himself many times, and made sure every part of the movie matched the picture in his mind.  He even drew the portraits himself!

Romance Amidst Disaster,AaronCapenBanner,11 December 2013,"James Cameron directed this massive blockbuster hit about the ill-fated maiden voyage of the Titanic in April 1912.

An old version of Rose(played by Gloria Stuart) recounts the romance and tragedy to treasure hunters(led by Bill Paxton) who are looking for a fabled jewel aboard the wreck, which Rose does indeed know something about... Hated by some, resented by others, I still love this film, which works magnificently as a tragic love story and as disaster picture, with outstanding F/X that are still realistic. The full extent of the tragedy is not overshadowed by the romance at all, which is put in proper perspective.

brilliant,tennis_ace102,23 November 2007,This movie is brilliant i only understood this movie when i was 9 but from then on it has remained one of my favourites.Great acting threw the whole movie. Leornado and Kate were brilliant as Jack and Rose.The love story of jack and rose is simply beautiful It was a dream love story that you could only wish for until the Titanic hit the ice berg and then while the chaos was going on there love for each other shined threw Any guy who cares for a girl so much that he helps her to surive yet puts himself at risk of death is beautiful What made this movie special is the love story The Love story made the movie not so predictable because you didn't expect there to be this different side of it we all know what happened to the ship but we didn't know about this romance whether it was non fictional or fictional by the end i was in tears because of how sad it was but also because of how beautiful it was from the plot to the acting to the writing the movie was just Beautiful.,9/10
Boring film without originality.,dasa108,3 December 2022,"During the heyday of catastrophe movies back in the 1970s, we used to see the following narrative thread: presentation of characters, dramas or challenges that each of them must overcome, the happy and tragic interaction between them, an accident or terrible situation and finally accept that many will die but what will make us better will be triumphant. Titanic simply adopts this recipe and puts her on board an ocean liner (just like the Poseidon) where she presents us with the classic love triangle where tragedy will cut love at the finest thread. In all a declaration of principles it is easier to survive when you are rich and debauched than when you are poor and sensitive. The film lacks originality and the only thing decent is the sequence of chaos and destruction and you need to watch a lot of bland footage to get there. The film is not original, it is not a masterpiece and it is not entertaining.",2/10

Continues to Impress,gradyharp,2 January 2012,"TITANIC, that preposterously beautiful film made in 1997 with a very young Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, James Cameron's Magnum Opus, continues to impress, especially when viewed yet again on New Year's Day 2012 - a fifteen year old film that remains one of the most impressive cinematic achievements from Hollywood. One of the many reasons it remains resonant is the manner in which the film addresses class systems - the wealthy versus the poor is a hot topic today and the film shows us why - and the extraordinary cinematic recreation of the sinking of that mighty ship.But for many the manner in which Cameron sets the tone of the story, the reminiscence of the elderly Rose unraveling the tale to her granddaughter and crew of ship Keldysh attempting to raise the Titanic now 84 years on the bottom of the ocean and carrying that theme through the course of the film, seems more cogent today than even at movie's release. Gloria Stewart is radiant as the old Rose and her rapt audience includes Bill Paxton, Suzy Amis, Lewis Abernathy, Nicholas Cascone, and Anatoly M. Sagalevitch. From there the opulence of the 'unsinkable' Titanic unfolds and the gradual love affair between Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) and poor artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio), a relationship at risk from the brewings of Rose's mother (Frances Farmer) and Rose's intended (Billly Zane). The cruise lasted from April 10, 1912 to April 15, 1912, but it was a lifetime of commitment between the young lovers.In retrospect the performances by some fine actors who would continue to rise is of note: Ioan Gruffudd, Victor Garber, David Warner, Danny Nucci etc. The film could have used some editing to reduce the length, and the presence of the unsinkable Molly Brown (Kathy Bates in a wasted role) though historically accurate ads very little to the film and even distracts a bit. Still TITANIC is just that - titanic - and no matter how many times we see it, it never fails to impress. Grady Harp",10/10
Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea,Lejink,10 October 2021,"The big daddy of disaster movies, less a full stop than a triple exclamation mark to the sub-genre. Like a modern-day De Mille, James Cameron sets out a 3 hour plus movie and delays the big event, the encounter with the iceberg, until more than halfway through the feature, confident that by that stage he has the expectant audience in his grip and can hold them for another ninety minutes till the end. I seem to remember lengthy movies like ""Ben Hur"", ""Ryan's Daughter"" or of course ""Gone With The Wind"" coming with an intermission roughly halfway through but there's no such break here as Cameron knows that by the time the water starts to pour into the stricken ship, no one will want to leave their seat.The big question of course is does he do enough in that first 100 minutes to make us care for the central characters he's created, namely Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack and Kate Winslet's Rose. He contrives a highly improbable story around the king of all Magoffins, a long-lost priceless diamond which appears to be the motivation for today's treasure-seeking expedition and asks us to accept that a still-alive 101 year old lady, the subject of a nude portrait found onboard depicted wearing the diamond, holds the key as to its whereabouts.Yes, that framing story, rather like the unlucky Titanic itself, doesn't hold much water when held up to examination being a florid slice of highly-theatrical melodrama, complete with its own pantomime villain in the shape of Billy Zane and I'll be honest in that once the calamity occurs I cared as much, indeed more about the hundreds of fellow-passengers teeming behind the leads, as I knew that they weren't really fictional and represented the 1500 lives lost that day.Putting that aside though, it's all about the effects which even looked at now, almost 25 years on, are truly remarkable. From the ship's engine-room, to its grand dining room and outer decks, the magnificence of the boat is wonderfully recreated while the the fateful crash into the iceberg, the panic which followed, the sinking of the boat and the chilling aftermath of the dead and dying strewn across the freezing Atlantic are conveyed with ""You are there""-type realism.Despite what I said about the importance of the SFX to the whole enterprise, it's impossible to deny the charm of DiCaprio and Winslet's performances and their own chemistry in bringing their highly idealised characters to life, but there's no question at all that the boat is the real star here.",8/10

Get rid of Kate and Leo and the first two hours,GregC-2,15 March 1999,"The technical execution of the ship sinking is entertaining. The rest of the movie is worthless dribble.I can understand why an adolescent girl would sigh over some dumb little twerp proclaiming his love with his dying breath to a woman he has known for two days. However, anyone over the age of 15 who doesn't have to suppress a gag reflex at the idea has no standards at all. There was no chemistry between the leads. The writing was atrocious. Cameron failed miserably to develop any empathy for any of the major characters. The movie sank long before the ship did.A bad, bad, bad movie. The worst movie to win Best Picture since Forrest Gump. And that took some doing.",1/10
"Ultimately, a unique and unusual film",Red-Barracuda,18 March 2011,"Seeing as Titanic is one of the most financially successful films of all time and whose storyline is know by almost everybody, I have decided not to base this review so much on the content of the film. Instead I would prefer to to look at how this movie is in fact something of a one-off historically.The uniqueness of Titanic in film history is down to a couple of inter-related things. Firstly, it stands apart as being a picture that combines state-of-the-art special effects technology within the frame-work of a romantic epic. Never before or since has this been done and it goes some way to explain the film's phenomenal success. This leads onto the other element of Titanic that is unusual ‚Äì the fact that a mega-budget blockbuster was quite clearly aimed primarily at women. Again, in the age of the blockbuster this tactic is just not the done thing. James Cameron has always been an action film director who is very female-aware. From Aliens through to Avatar, his movies always feature unusually strong women in central roles; often as the main identifiable action figure. So perhaps it's not, therefore, surprising that with Titanic Cameron should create the ultimate female-centric special-effects blockbuster. This approach paid off of course, women especially went in droves to see it, and the film went super-nova at the box-office.For the first half of the film we have a romance. A cross-class romance that is doomed from the start, in the same way as we all know the famous ocean liner is. The parallels between these two story lines ultimately compliment each other ‚Äì the love story gives the disaster a personal edge, while in turn, the disaster gives the love story an epic tragic quality. The first time I watched the film I thought the romantic plot was an unnecessary and annoying addition, the second time I began to understand that it gives the film an emotional basis that it feeds off. I now have a great deal more respect for this most unfashionable and often vilified of Hollywood movies. It's uniqueness in film history too in terms of its approach and audience demographic is also something worth at least a little respect. It's unusual combination of special-effects driven action with period-set romance is not likely to be repeated very soon, and Titanic, therefore, will at the very least remain a one-off in film history.",7/10
Titanic is my favorite movie.,9thgraders,20 June 2017,"Titanic is a movie of romance and drama. The director of this awesome film is called James Cameron. Well done to the director! Titanic was made in 1997. The main characters of this movie are Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet. This story is about two characters, Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio), who meet on the Titanic. On this boat, a terrible catastrophe will occur. The Titanic will sink. It's terrible...The main music of this movie is very melancholic. Every time, I start crying because I imagine it's my family on this boat...The specials effects are very realistic! But maybe it was actually filmed in the Atlantic! I don't know, but it's possible.Personally, I really love this movie. It is amazing!

From the director of Terminator comes an R-rated horrifying movie about a boat that sinks and people die. Not suited for the faint of hearted. Terribly shocking,imseeg,23 February 2020,"I, like many of my age, saw this when it originally aired as a class assignment. It had a great impact on me. The movie may not be the greatest ever made, but the acting is more than adequate, especially from Jason Robards, and the script was far better than any other movies made for television at that time. I recommend it to anyone, even those with a low tolerance for grossness (radiation sickness is shown in progressive stages, and it is not pretty). It's dark, depressing, and if you get into it you will definitely need to follow it up with a musical or cartoons just to lift your spirits again. Still, the subject matter is not something that can be portrayed positively even at a tv-movie level of realism.",No Rating
"NOT THE BEST, but not the worst",C.S.Wood,24 April 1999,"In my quest to write up to 50 reviews here at IMDB, it's time for the James Cameron flick.Well, it was definitely NOT the best film ever made. I think I liked it a lot when I first saw it in 97 (note: I only saw it ONCE at the theater), but now it's coming on HBO, like, every few hours. And when you catch the same parts playing over and over again you can tell how much you wish Cameron would've taken a few more writing classes when he was younger.The very best thing about Titanic was just that: The ship. The ship was the movie, and watching it sink was the real masterpiece of filming. Most of DiCaprio and Winslet's scenes together got tedious and was underwritten on some parts. It seemed like they were 90's people sent back in time to learn the ways of the early 1900's and failed to do so, which was exactly the case.I think Cameron is a great filmmaker, and am glad the movie was a success so that he cam bring us other movies. But, he I had wished he learned to be a better director and find out to make great movies without a colossal budget. But even if Titanic only costed 70-100 and came out the same I still wouldn't have liked it any more or less. Overall, it was a nice movie but could've been A LOT better.",5/10
Hard to be impartial about it.,moses-11,20 June 1999,"I figured that everyone who voted would give it either a 10 or a zero, so I knew that my vote of six would be next to useless.  No, it's not worth a ten, but not so bad as to give it a zero.  Anyway, after watching it (on cable, not the big screen), I had to think about my feelings about it before commenting.  The obvious things have all been said: the bad script, etc. But what I was bothered by was the cinematography.  The use of filters and such was too prevalent.  I realize this was to diffuse the light and give everything a soft, antique-y look, but it bothered me nonetheless.I watch movies and ask myself, ""What does this scene add to the overall movie?""  In many cases with this film, the answer was ""Nothing at all.""  I understand the importance of establishing shots, but I don't see the need for them to be that long.  I got up once to go to the bathroom, and when I returned, it was still the long, sweeping, panoramic establishing shot! Ok, by this time I had figured out it was a big ship.I also didn't think the whole ""outside"" story set in the present was necessary, but I guess James Cameron wanted something to differentiate this story from all the other 'true love versus class struggle' stories.I do often get emotional at sad movies (hard for a guy to admit), but I didn't cry for this one, for whatever reason.  It seemed too fake, I guess.",6/10
Next To Last Blockbuster At Theatre Box Office,DKosty123,5 December 2006,"In 1997, this film became a must see for a lot of people. There were several factors that caused this. The film featured some of the first shots of the actual Titanic on the ocean floor after it sank. It featured early glimpses of the technology that had been developed by Robert Ballard to get those pictures. It offered one of the first true tellings of how the ship really sank as finding it in the ocean had finally revealed more details about what really happened to it.This movie has the trade mark James Carmeron hokey love story. He just re-did it in the Sci-Fi movie Avatar. This is becoming the trademark of all his films as Avatar is his first movie since this one. Will Cameron ever do a movie without one?Titanic's story is better than Avatar simply because the story here is framed better. There is true History here to base the film on & this is much better than the story for Avatar which is negative without merit. We have the ship of dreams, the star of the ocean diamond, the provocative drawing. We have the ultimate ship which has become legend for yet another generation thanks to this epic remake. The love story is Camerons jewel & the necklace the ultimate symbol.Leonardo DiCaprio has the highlight role of his career here. So far, no role he has done since matches it. This film was the right time & right place for him. Right place because he got to play after the luscious Kate Winslet. She was another unknown to most audiences, but so far this is her best film too. The rest of the cast is OK, but other than the actress who plays Kate as an old lady, they don't stand out much.Special effects appealed to sell tickets too. The ship sets were so expensive, so well done & so detailed, that they actually became tourist attractions after the movie was made there. Add all these factors plus no real other film in theaters when this was released, & you understand why it sold so many tickets.It might be the last movie to sell so many tickets. Well made hit films now do well for a few weeks, but then a lot of folks wait for the DVD before they watch it. This & the new television technology which has made home theater type television possible, has changed the public theater into a less appealing venue.Do I like this film? Yes, it is a good film, but 1 viewing is all I needed to take it all in. I still dream about Kate Winslet & wish Leonardo would try & match his acting in a newer effort.",9/10
The four stars is a gift,snakeguy76,5 January 2006,"OK this movie was out for two months when I saw this so maybe my expectations was a little high, but with all the hype and money spent making it, it should have been high. This movie would have been better if it was just about the sinking. I like love stories but sticking in corny old love story - rich girl doesn't want to marry rich jerk but instead falls in love with the bohemian artist - boy how original. It took away form the great sinking. I got tired of them running though the water. Cameron does not have a knack for writing good dialog.Some other parts made no sense - why would billy Zanes character go through this whole thing about stealing the diamond? the boat is sinking and they locking him up in a room? What is wrong here? And the worst plot twist that will forever make me hate this movie is the diamond. She keeps the diamond all these years and decides that tossing it into the ocean 70 years later was the right course of action? What the ""beep""! First of all it was given to her by her fianc√©. He was a jerk but if she didn't love him she should have given it back. INstead she hides form everyone and pretends she dies and hold onto the diamond. Why throw it in? That diamond had a long history long before she ever got it and she just got the thing. Now it will forever be trapped at the bottom of the sea. It might have made sense if it was Dicaprio who gave it to her, but it was Billy Zane.Oh man I can go on and one about what annoyed me about this movie.But this is just my opinion. I know there are many who loved it. But tossing the diamond is not an opinion its just plain WrONG",4/10
Taking Titanic seriously will end in disaster,intern-88,6 June 2012,"The announcement that James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster, Titanic, was to be rereleased to mark the centenary of the ocean liner's disastrous maiden voyage was met with a considerable amount of vitriol from historians and cultural critics.Alongside the somewhat more sober events set to take place on 15 April to commemorate the sinking of the 'unsinkable ship' - including an exhibition in Belfast, where RMS Titanic was built, and a series of seminars in Nova Scotia, close to where it sank - many saw this as Cameron once again cashing in on the tragedy with his fiercely sentimental film. The fact that it has been remastered in 3D has made its release feel all the more in poor taste.I was all of six years old when Titanic first hit our screens. It was, of course, one of the biggest blockbusters of my childhood. So large was its impact, in fact, that on several occasions during my schooling I was subjected to Titanic-themed history and art projects, all of which involved watching the three-and-a-bit-hour behemoth as a primary piece of research. In the years since, it has become the nostalgia movie of choice among my friends. So I've seen it more times than I'd care to count. Seeing it remastered on the big screen, however, made its inadequacy as a historical film more laughably evident than ever.Given the policed divide between the haughty classes of the upper decks and the lowly paupers of steerage, and the shameful priority given to the wealthy when it came to filling the lifeboats, the Titanic tragedy has often been held up as a telling snapshot of the class politics of the time. Through the star-crossed, and completely fictional, love affair between penniless rogue Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and drippy debutante Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), Cameron attempts to explore the inherent tensions which the ship contained. This rendering, however, is reductive to say the least: the gilded dining rooms of first class are populated by sarcastic, brandy-swilling poshos and the steerage is full of arm-wrestling Germanics and Guinness-guzzling Irishmen who are prone to punch one another or break into a fiddle recital at the slightest provocation. Probably the most coherent message about class we are given, as the two lovers move between their respective camps, is that it's much more fun to dance a jig below decks than it is to discuss oil prices over caviar.The stories that survived the ship's demise are a mix of startling inhumanity and incredible heroism. But Cameron's manipulative approach often robs his material of its inherent pathos and breeds drastic historical inaccuracies. In its turbulent second half, poignant moments come thick and fast, but many of them are either wholly fictional or shamelessly skewed for the sake of taking some cheap tugs at the heartstrings. The 'unsinkable' Molly Brown, who in the real tragedy insisted the half-full lifeboats return to collect those still stranded in the ice-cold water, is robbed of her triumphant moment and recast as a much less domineering symbol of feminine subordination. Similarly, as is widely known, the ship's string quartet played on top deck as the Titanic went down, in order to calm the passengers, but even this incredible part of the tale is soured by the schmaltz Cameron lays over the scene. As the quartet finish their rendition of 'Orpheus and Eurydice', one of the violinists turns to his fellow musicians and says, 'Gentleman, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight'. Such candy-coated moments continually deaden the impact of the film's rich source material.Cameron once quipped that he only agreed to make the film because a free deep sea dive to the Titanic wreck came as part of the package, suggesting this was never intended to be his magnum opus. Indeed, given the director's famous meticulousness, the film feels like he has been oddly careless in places. Kate Winslet's accent is allowed to wander between American, Irish and English with little consequence, and despite a rigorous casting process for the part of Rose's malevolent fianc√© Cal - which saw innumerable famous actors rejected - the appalling Billy Zane was selected, who ends up playing the role like a camp Count Dracula.Despite all this, the clunking one-liners, the dreadful acting and the cheesy artifice actually gives Titanic its distinctive charm. When watching the released film on the big screen, I was surprised to find that most of my fellow audience members were giggling along at all of the abysmal moments, which also had kept me returning to it over the years. For myself and others it seems, this film is more of a trip down 90s memory lane than it is an historically accurate snapshot of a turn-of-the-century tragedy. As such, criticising Titanic on the grounds of historical infidelity is tantamount to damning Top Gun for giving a rose-tinted portrayal of the lives of fighter pilots - doing so would be to miss the point of what makes these films so memorable.I completely agree with those who feel Titanic has no place in the proceedings for the centenary of the original tragedy. Not because Cameron's tacky blockbuster does a disservice to the 1,517 people who lost their lives, but because this film is so inescapably naff that really it shouldn't be taken that seriously. I urge fans to go and enjoy this guilty pleasure with a clear conscience",6/10
Three cheers for the iceberg,aandmbird,24 November 2010,"This may contain spoilers, although nothing I say could spoil any further this utterly shoddy and offensive piece of junk anymore than many of the comments already on this site. This films stinks from bow to stern. The banal and predictable dialogue and plot are only matched by its crass stupidity in the ludicrous national stereotyping. Jolly ""Oirish"" down in steerage begorrah, moustache twirling English villains and heroic Yanks (yawn). So far so predictable and in itself would make for a comedically bad film. However I found the persistent national stereotyping became more offensive as the film went on and came to head as the boat(and the film) finally sank. I'm sure I wasn't the only one hoping an albatross would drop something unpleasant on Kate Winslet as she stood on the front of the ship in that buttock clenchingly corny scene. The only thing I found moving was the bile in my stomach. Unfortunately some gullible people will take this as a historical document. It is not. Go and see ""A night to Remember"" instead.",1/10
"Historically Accurate for its Time, Yet is Hindered by it being Directed by James Cameron",Raptorclaw155,3 May 2020,"One of the interesting things about this film is that it's pretty clear how Titanic and Avatar are both cut from, essentially, the same cloth despite being two completely different films on paper.As it is widely understood, a lot of time, effort, and money went into making this film possible and it shows. Aside from a couple moments here and there, Titanic is still a fairly impressive looking film to date. Of course, nowadays there is more information about Titanic's interior design with the aid of 20 more years of research behind us and, thus, there are some inaccuracies in this film in that regard, as well as the way the ship sank, but overall, it is clear that they went to painstaking lengths to make this film look as accurate and authentic as possible and I think they succeeded. Of course when you have James Cameron at the helm, usually films end up turning out looking quite impressive so it's no surprise that this film would be any different.However, James Cameron is also one of the reasons why this film falls very short of what it could have been. This has much to do with the quality of writing and its execution. Cal Hockley is little short of a diet James Bond villain and I have no idea what his motivations for pursuing his obviously aloof fiancee aside from serving as an antagonist for Jack. The guy shows no interest in Rose, yet he says he loves her and it seems like the film, at some point, is trying to frame him as being truthful about it- but who knows at this point? On top of that, there's also the same writing trap that this film fall into as Avatar would years later with the very cartoonish poor people good, rich people bad theme which only ages worse when one looks into the real reasons why ships of that time were organized by class.There's also a lot of blatant misrepresentation when it comes to a myriad of issues including the crew of the Titanic and the ship's lifeboat situation-which are all comments made with the aide of hindsight- which makes for a pretty bad representation of history.One of my biggest criticisms of this kind of love story is that usually the female lead is fairly plain and the male lead is where all the personality and likability is. For Titanic, the reverse is true. Rose is extremely likable and has a lot of personality and Kate Winslet is the star of the show, in my opinion. Jack is quite plain on the other hand. I know DiCaprio is a popular actor but I didn't feel as if he really added anything to this role. It just seemed that they hired him to play himself.Despite my criticisms, this is still a pretty well-made film. It has a lot of issues but it is still worth seeing. The love story is predictable but I don't think people watch romance films for their expectations to be subverted anyway. It's far from a bad film, and despite its 3 hour run time it makes excellent use of it. This is probably the date night film to end all date night films until The Notebook came out at the very least that says something.",6/10

An Epic Tragedy.,OllieSuave-007,26 November 2013,"This is an epic tragedy movie about aristocrat Rose DeWitt Bukater falling in love with poor artist Jack Dawson, aboard the doomed Titanic. It is a beautiful but typical love story that captures the audience's hearts, providing a compelling subplot among the more tragic main story of the ill-fated voyage.Many of the movie's element was directed with excellence: the actors provided a solid and believable performance; the cinematography was beautiful; the music score was moving; and the sceneries and settings aboard the ship, amidst the flashy and famed lifestyles of aristocracy and amidst the poor but carefree lives of the townspeople and artists, were brilliant.The scenes of each character's fate after the Titanic started sinking is extremely powerful, haunting, and sometimes disturbing. The film quickly shifts from an emotional love story, which I thought was, unfortunately, pretty boring, to a heart-wrenching tragedy that cannot help but send chills down your spine (where most of the action lies).This movie is a little on the long side though, with several filler scenes that drag away from the main plot. Some sequences of Jack and Rose were pretty clich√© - reminding you too much of a teenage-bop love story. While I am not a big drama fan, this movie is a good exception for pure, dramatic entertainment, but not one I would watch over and over again.Grade C",6/10
CHICK-FLICK ALERT!!!,jester-22,20 January 1999,"For those of you unfamiliar with the term chick-flick.

Be it the Victorian-England costume drama, the Shakespere movie, or pretty much anything starring Maryl Streep.Titanic is a major-leage chick flick.I saw this movie (once) and have to say that, while the special effects of the last 45 minutes were really cool, the rest of the movie was typical chick flick.  It was a bad story, combined with bad acting, bad dialog, bad script-writing, and a really bad theme song (if I hear that Celine Dion song one more time I'm gonna freakin' rip my hair out) .Now some people are gonna say to me ""Oh yeah, how do you explain the box-office records?"".  Well, have you ever seen the theater line for Titanic?  99% of the patronage is young girls who keep pictures of Leonardo DiCrappio in their purses and have seen Titanic 25 times each.

The costume designs, set decorations, cinematography, and special effects were definitely worthy of notice, but nothing else. And to realize that this worthless piece of trash won the Best Picture Oscar over L.A. Confidential, a brainy, stylish, police drama, is unbelievably pathetic. But then again, I have noticed that most of the viewing public, including critics and Hollywood, don't like to think too much. In that case, this movie's for you!",1/10

Is the opening logo the same or different in both versions? Just wondering as I could never get any info about the Europe release. Great film in any case although critics claim that Ja√ßk could have survived as there was enough room on the floating door. Had he survived, he probably would have married Rose & would have been pursued by her fiance, this would have made for a different ending. I feel the ending was perfect as is.

JAMES CAMERON'S HOMAGE TO SELZNICK AND LEAN,mpofarrell,26 October 2003,"Jame's Cameron's ""Titanic"" struck a chord with movie goers of all ages for one simple reason : it moved. As corny and implausible as the screenplay is, Cameron nevertheless seamlessly weaved historical fact with soap opera fiction to create a movie that hearkened back to Hollywood's Golden Age. Is ""Titanic"" the equal of ""Gone With The Wind""? Not by several knots. But it is a monumental production by any standards and in 1997 was the most sensational thing to come down the pike since the glory days of David O. Selznick  and David Lean. ""Titanic"" is a grand, immensely entertaining extravaganza.",No Rating
"Beautiful, fascinating and positively iconic",hyper777,12 March 2010,"This is an INCREDIBLE movie. Every bit of it was beautifully shot, and the accuracies to the look of the actual Titanic were miraculously on point. This movie is, in one word, iconic. Everyone knew the Titanic, and now everyone knows this movie. It is arguably one of the most famous love stories of all time, and although the concept is tired: rich girl meets poor boy, they can't be together, etc., the fact that they are aboard the infamous RMS Titanic is reason enough to consider it different. Every scene is gorgeously picturesque, and makes for some of the most memorable movie moments ever. The actors are also great, and the characters really make this story. Although Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet aren't quite yet at their prime in their most famous movie, they play these characters convincingly and with a lot of heart. You feel for them every step of the way, and DiCaprio and Winslet have a chemistry that simply can't be matched. You can tell how much they care about each other as people, and that translates into a fiercely protective, emotionally powerful romance on screen. Overall, this movie is one of the best out there. Its length (around three hours) may bother some people, but it never feels tedious to watch. James Cameron is an impeccable director that looks to make every detail perfect, and some of the small, seemingly insignificant scenes he added were a few of the most moving of the entire film. Titanic is a passionate, beautiful story of a doomed love that will keep your heart racing and your tears flowing until the very end.",10/10
Still Stands The Test of Time,CurtMan@LVCM.com,21 October 2004,"I am simply amazed that such a popular, beloved, critically and audience acclaimed film favorite as ""Titanic"" could sink so unseemly in the minds of so many who shelled out heavy sums of money and lauded it heavily at the time of its tremendous popularity. While ""Titanic"" is hardly as fresh, riveting, and entertaining as it was when I first viewed it several years ago, it still certainly retains a special distinction in the realm of cinema, at least in my assessment. Perhaps the screenplay is overly blase, full of clich√©s, and historical blunders, and the spectacle and sheer horror of seeing hundreds plummet to the bottom of the Atlantic is not as harrowing as it seemed in theaters, yet ""Titanic"" is still a fine, worthy, and sensational cinematic triumph. ""Titanic""'s technical aspects: its impeccable mix of sound and visual effects, dramatic and potent musical score (detract the obsolete ""My Heart Will Go On""), ingenious costume design, absorbing cinematography, and of course the gorgeous, stupendous design of the ship, still stand well above many efforts in cinematic history today, and are plenty appreciated and admired. The romance between Rose and Jack is perhaps the most clich√© and nauseating aspect of the film, which, despite the film's perception as being ""extremely overrated"" might be ""Titanic""'s primary detractor, and that would be fully understandable- if these same critics weren't the ones who rushed to the cinemas to embrace the romance in the film! Overall, ""Titanic"" is a leviathon of a film: boasting popularity and critical acclaim and some really brilliant cinematic aspects, where it somewhat lacks in the script and the romance. I have probably viewed ""Titanic"" over 100 times, and though its value and enticement has been compromised through numerous viewings, it still retains a laudable, important distinction as providing both rock-solid entertainment and brilliant cinematic quality, and these features are too complimentary for such a film as ""Titanic"" to sink through history. ***1/2 out of ****",9/10
A very good movie.,filipemanuelneto,3 September 2016,"This film focuses on the tragic first voyage of the British luxury steamer RMS Titanic, which sank in the North Atlantic. Directed and written by James Cameron, the film features Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The soundtrack, one of the most iconic of cinema, is James Horner.Titanic will always be the icon of the golden age of maritime passenger transport. The biggest of steamers, the most luxurious of luxury ships, it was the largest ship in the world at the time and it was said that it was unsinkable. Unfortunately, everything is made of iron can sink. The negligence of the responsible for the ship, which ignored all warnings of ice and never prepared it with enough lifeboats to all the people inside it, led to a huge and unnecessary tragedy.In the midst of all, we have the unlikely love between Rose, a rich girl, and Jack, a young who grew up in the streets. It's the classic clich√© ""rich girl loves poor boy"" or, in this case, ""adventurer, eager to make a fortune, loves rich and bored girl who wants to feel strong emotions"". Their story is similar to many others and, in addition to never be credible enough, it quickly becomes cloying and boringly predictable, and gives voice to the preconceived ideas of Cameron, showing social ""barriers"" rich/poor ( symbolized in the film by locked doors between the ship classes) as if they were divisions between good and bad. World is not so simple, so dark-and-gray, and divisions like that still exists today, in other ways.The choice of the two main actors was excellent. Although still young and not well known, they have become stars. DiCaprio was the pretty face of the girl's wet dreams for a long time thanks to this movie, and even had to take off the heartthrob image later to diversify his career. In fact, he is a talented actor, as Kate, and both worked well in the romantic scenes. The film also contains stunning scenes of the ship, whose interiors have been carefully re- created and then destroyed during the scene of the wreck. The details are excellent, they were in the collective memory for the quality that was achieved. Special and sound effects are also excellent.",8/10
There IS room on the raft!,damianphelps,28 September 2020,"Not my favourite film by any stretch. It became a film much like Greencard that just became trendy to watch and like way beyond any actual evidence of being a great film.It is waaay too long and surprisingly bland. It could be compared to the Poseidon Adventure, an epic ship sinking disaster movie, but it decided to focus on the love story of the two protagonists. For me that was a poor choice, it could have been a drama of high tension.But no. Just the worlds longest romance novel.",5/10
TITANIC in 3-D is even better than the original,duraflex,12 April 2012,"James Cameron really knows how to tell a story and make an amazing movie.This film holds up brilliantly 15 years after its initial release. The new 3-D version is fantastic - especially the shots of the ship. The underwater scenes are stunning. It is all done masterfully.How they go back and remake a live action film into 3-D is a mystery to me but the magic works. In recent years, I choose to see most films on DVD or Blu-Ray, but this one was worth a trip to the theater. I never left my seat once.Seeing the film again since the real life passing of Gloria Stuart (old Rose) and seeing it on the 100th anniversary of Titanic's one and only sailing made it that much more poignant.",10/10
No. That's all. Just... No.,guru-12,10 November 1999,"Titanic wins many awards in my book.  Worst Script of 1997, for starters. Then there's Worst Overacting (Billy Zane), Worst Underacting (Leonardo DiCaprio), Worst Song (""My Heart Will Go On""--if only Celine Dion had gone down with the ship) and probably more.  That's just scratching the surface on how disgusted I was with this movie.  Particularly the script.  Why can't Jim Cameron just stick with the technical stuff he's so brilliant at?  Who told that clown he could write?  Moreover, who told him he could write dialogue?  I hope and pray, for the sake of the legacy we bring our descendants, that this movie never makes any important Top 100 List.  People tend to take those things so seriously.  And this movie has nothing that should be taken seriously.",5/10
an epic disaster that's not for everyone,alysbrangwin,30 May 2005,"Titanic has a lot of fans and a lot of detractors. The movie itself is a technical masterpiece. James Cameron showed things that people had never seen before, such as going down into the actual wreckage with this little machine. The movie came out when I was 12, and since I was one of the millions of girls who were head over heels in love with Leonardo DiCaprio, I went to see it four times in the theater.As I said, technically this movie is just brilliant. Some of the technology is a little bit outdated: if you look closely enough, you can pick out the computer images, but I don't think those detract from the visuals. The sets and costumes are absolutely marvelous. The music is also beautiful and haunting, and it's just right for the film's mood. I've always thought that the love theme ""My Heart Will Go On"" is cheesy, but effective in conveying the message of the film.Of course the movie is about the Titanic, but that is really the backdrop for the love-across-class-lines story between Rose DeWitt Bukater and Jack Dawson. When I was 12 of course, this was absolutely fantastic. Now I see it a bit differently, but I do find it appealing nonetheless. The idea is a little bit ludicrous considering how the ship was built and isolated the upper class from those in steerage. A woman being able to break away from that is also pretty doubtful, but nonetheless if you can get over that you can see the love story for what it is, and that its message is love transcends all obstacles. This is a great movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon when it's rainy outside and you've got nothing better to do.Aside from the love story you have the entire tragic loss of life from the sinking of the ship. I think this was both well-done by Cameron visually and the viewer sees the absurdity of course in Rose's jumping off the lifeboat to return to Jack. Again though we understand as an audience that we're going to be experiencing the foundering of this ship through the eyes of our two star-cross'd lovers, so the audience just has to roll with the punches here. Some of the shots here are amazing, and it gets a little ghastly when the ship breaks in half and people start falling off and hitting propellers and getting landed on by the stern of the ship.The dialogue in this movie, however, is far from stellar. The worst parts are the modern day pieces with Gloria Stewart and Bill Paxton's acting is as flat as the Great Plains. Again you just have to roll with the punches to get to the good stuff, which is all the material when they're on the Titanic. Billy Zane makes a great villain, and so does Frances Fisher as the mother. Kate Winslet I think did an excellent job given some of her lines are a bit dull, but I think she still pulls it off convincingly. Leonardo DiCaprio is also a good actor, and although some of his lines are terrible, you can see in him the youth and vibrancy that a poor young artist must have when he's gotten the chance of a lifetime.It's interesting to look at the roles of these women too, as Rose is not portrayed as a damsel in distress, but more of a young woman who's confused and angry and trapped in her upper class world. While it may sound like a poor little rich girl story, Kate Winslet convinces you that it's not just about her resenting her position in society. If you were Rose, you'd be unhappy too.Overall I still love this movie. It's a great disaster film and has a lot of those classic elements. The direction and the sets and costumes are visually dazzling, and some of the acting is not superb, but overall I still say it's a good movie. It's definitely worth watching once, if only for the sets and the sinking of the ship.",8/10
James takes a shot at romance,catch_a_fire_2079,1 March 2010,"I remember boycotting Titanic for years. We were taught about the Titanic in school, so when the movie came out, I thought it was pointless, we all knew the ship hit an iceberg and sank.Well after it came out on VHS, I happened to see it one day and it did not disappoint. I don't like the genre of romance so much, but this movie made me appreciate a good love story.Yes it was the classic Romeo and Juliet scenario, or rather rich girl poor boy. But it was so much more. The acting was superb, I didn't like Leo before this film, and Kate took the cake, especially when she was posing nude...This movie put a face (although fictional) to the thousand or so people that died that night in icy water off of the coast of Newfoundland. You almost felt the thousand knives stabbing you as Leo and Kate were plunged into the water. You kinda felt like the King of the World when Leo was flying high.The Movie was very well acted, the set was amazing, down to every last detail...even the plates said Titanic on them, you really felt you were in the opulent world of the early 20th century high society. The story telling was also beautiful. You also got a taste of what it might be like to party with the ""2nd class"" immigrants that were coming for a new life in America...I really felt the sense of adventure all the actors tried to portray.I highly recommend this movie.Not sure why it's not in the top 250 on IMDb, also anyone that would give this film 1 star doesn't know much about movies.",8/10
Hollywood rubish,Semih,21 June 2000,"I don't like movies that are made by the rules of ""hollywood filmmaking"". What I mean by that is the way to make the audience sad, happy, worried, thrilled, are all the same way that all the same in all big budget hollywood films. Titanic is another one of those films. So it didn't give me anything.James Horner's music sucked! And I was so mad at him getting the undeserved oscar for original score. That year the statue should have gone to Jerry Goldsmith's original score for L.A. Confidential! The popularity of Titanic shows how easily entertained the average movie going audience is.",2/10
fleecing of the American movie public is now complete,AdamGott,5 January 1999,"Not only did I consider this movie a very over-rated piece of tripe (bad acting, bad dialogue, predictable story, great effects - i.e. your typical American action film of the 90's) but now I have to fear the possible repercussions of this film.  This will surely send the signal to Hollywood that we want more big budget movies that focus more on effects than story (Godzilla, Armageddon, Lost In Space, Sphere).  Cameron would have done well to edit this into a much tighter two hour movie by cutting out the ridiculous 'action' scenes that clogged the middle of the movie.",5/10
Titanic: A disaster indeed.,Yodagirl-2,13 August 1999,"While the popular thing to do would be to simply say, this movie sucks, without any particular reasons why, I won't. The reason why it drew so much attention was mostly because rabid, drooling females saw that Leonardo DiCaprio was in it.  While he may not be a bad actor at all, to rate a movie as very high, simply because one of the actors is very ""hot"" is extremely stupid indeed.  While the plot wasn't that bad, the problem was that everyone knew the outcome...the ship was going to sink and a bunch of people were going to die.  In cutting off this suspense from the viewers, the effectiveness of the film was partially destroyed.Another thing that bothered me was how the rich passengers (exceptions being Rose and Molly Brown) were all portrayed as uncaring, selfish, materialistic beings...apparently only  because they were wealthy.  This is an extremely biased and 2-D cardboard point of view.  In fact, the whole movie seemed very 2 dimensional and an insult to the real tragedy that occured.  It incured sympathy for them, but characters were often displayed as only good or only bad.  Humans are made up of both sides, and in this movie, the characters were either entirely noble, or entirely nasty.  It was given an Oscar for best picture, in my opinion, purely because it was one of the latest movies to come out and everyone was raving over it.  Fortunately, however, as Titanic's only following were fickle teenagers (my age group) who jump onto every new movie that comes along with cheers, proclaiming themselves ultimate fans, Titanic will soon disappear into oblivion.  Star Wars, although NOT winning an Oscar for best picture, triumphs in the end, for it has kept a large following for a good 25 years.  Titanic seems to be fading away after 2.",1/10
Cameron: Pompous Windbag,joelsaxton,5 May 2005,"There are a plethora of reviews here which concur with my sentiments, so I will refrain from expressing them in this review. I will say one thing, though: James Cameron's Oscar acceptance speech was the most ridiculous acceptance speech I have ever heard. Never mind the ""I'm the king of the world!"" line. How about his moment of silence for those who perished on the Titanic? Perhaps Cameron felt obligated to acknowledge the dead since he was making millions dramatizing their tragedy. Perhaps he was being sincere in his sympathies. I don't know. What I do know is that it was one of the most cringe-worthy moments in Academy history. But Cameron doesn't stop there; he simply cannot leave good-enough alone, so he continues to babble on incessantly as his head continues to expand. Whereas most actors and filmmakers at least make an attempt to conceal their egotism, Cameron is unabashedly vainglorious, boldly forsaking the humility smokescreen that so many others in show business rely upon for refuge.",5/10
Don't be too hard on a film that should have been great,Surfer-23,26 December 1999,"The search for a missing diamond is the excuse for this film to tell you a love story, and the love story is its excuse to tell you the story of Titanic. If you can let yourself be amazed by James Cameron's vision of both the boat and its sinking, and ignore most of what else the film is supposed to be about, you are in for a treat. Of course, the movie isn't what it could have been, and should have been. For the first half, we see how a fair damsel (Rose, played by Kate Winslet) is rescued from a life of misery by another fair damsel (Jack, played by Leonardo DiCaprio). Rose is a child of the Upper Class and is being forced to marry Cal, perhaps the most evil film character since Darth Vader and the most one-dimensional creature dreamed up since Euclid defined the line in geometry. Now, as we all know, rich people, like Rose and Cal, are repressed and have no sense of fun, while poor people, like Jack, are jolly and streetwise and like to dance, dance, dance. Jack must save Rose from her snobbish fiance and show her what life is really about. And if she falls in love with him in the meantime, well, all the better.This is not to say that the part of the film up until the disaster is wasted. It is here that we see Titanic in its glory, a sumptuous recreation of the most luxurious ship ever built. And we get to see a lot of it, too, from the bridge to the deck to first class to steerage to the engine room, mostly brought to us by means of Rose and Jack's merry frolicking.Then Titanic runs into an iceberg. This, of course, is what we came to see: How will the sinking be depicted? And, by the way, what DOES one do when one is on a doomed vessel surrounded by freezing water and there is not a hope of being rescued? By now Rose is trying to save Jack (now locked in the brig for a crime he did not commit), but they often seem more intent on saving their love than their lives. Which is more important is a matter of taste.Yet surrounding them are ""normal"" people, people who are terrified of drowning but who nevertheless have to think of something to do to save themselves and their families. There are moments of panic, bravery, cowardice, regret, disappointment, and selfishness, and even ones of extreme warmth and nobility. And, as you watch, you are constantly asking yourself, deep down, how you would fare under similar circumstances.
It is these glimpses of human behavior under the most dire circumstances, combined with Cameron's amazing technical work, that make this film more than worthwhile. It should have been much better, but it's still fine the way it is.",No Rating

It's as if I was there...,jennifer-99,21 December 2000,"To watch Titanic is not simply to watch a film about a love story on a sinking boat.....it is to experience the horrific tragedy as if you were on the ill fated voyage in 1912.  I marveled at Titanic's grandeur, I was inspired to dance by the rousing Celtic music at the ""3rd class party"", I felt their terror at the ship's impending demise, I despised the builders for the lack of life boats, I felt the mother's pain as she tucked her children in bed for the last time, I shuddered at the icy cold waters. Short of turning back the clock to 1912, this is the closest any of us are going to get to the ""Unsinkable Ship"".Mr. Cameron has done an impeccable job re-creating the Titanic and it was the effort that went into that alone which earned him the Oscars for Best Director and Best Picture.  The visuals were stunning from beginning to end and when watching the film on the big screen it truly was a sight to behold. As for the fictional part of the story, in spite of what many of the film's detractors had to say, I thought it was beautifully done.  DeCaprio and Winslet turned in brilliant performances and made the characters of Jack and Rose into people that we cared about.  We rooted for these star crossed lovers even though we all knew the fate of the ship.  I am not a fan of long movies and usually lose interest sometime after the second hour, but here the 3 plus hours simply flew by.  The movie draws you in and rivets you to the screen until the credits are rolled.  I can't remember a time where I have cried so earnestly for movie characters...not only for Jack and Rose, but for all the lost souls in the North Atlantic. I have re-watched this film several times and it has not lost its impact.

I mean, really, I have never seen anything like that before (or maybe I have, I just can't remember it). The point is that this movie captures you for like three hours, and never once did I look at the time and see how long it's been or how long it's left. This movie deserved all the Oscars, all the credit and all the good reviews. I love this movie, a classic movie, and I can't imagine how anyone would think it's bad or that it didn't deserve all the credit it got. Watch it and enjoy it and don't think about how long it is.

"Despite all the hype, this is still a good movie",The-Sarkologist,21 December 2013,"James Cameron is an amazing filmmaker. He made Terminator II, Abyss, and Aliens, and he has made this movie; one that is going to require some absolute brilliance to beat (what was I thinking when I wrote this?). At the end I just sat in my chair and did not say anything, there is nothing that can describe this movie. This is how a love story should be made.Titanic is a tragedy pure and simple. Right from the beginning you know that the ship is going to sink. We, the audience, knows what is going to happen, but we watch the crew and the wealthy wonder around fully convinced that the ship is invincible. All the problems with the ship are not known until after the ship has begun to sunk. The important part is the iceberg; they could not see it until it was too late to do anything about.This movie really brings out the contrast between the rich and the poor and brings out the idea that they seem to be two different people who live in two different worlds. On the Carpathia, the ship that picked up the survivors of the Titanic, when the wealthy fianc√© is looking for his beloved, he comes onto the deck full of the survivors from third class. The sailor says to him, ""there is nobody of your kind down here."" The distinction is purely artificial though. When Jack is invited up to dinner in first class, he is dressed up and the comments are that he is like one of them. The only difference between the two is the money, one has it while the other does not. But is having money all that good? The movie seems to say that it is not. We see Rose attempting to commit suicide, yet she has everything she could hope for as she is to marry a wealthy steel magnate.Yet Rose finds more interest in the young bohemian artist named Jack Dawson. She is willing to throw everything away just for this one young man. Of course this makes her fianc√© extremely jealous, but deep down she doesn't want him. Her continual snide remarks at the lifestyle of the rich shows that she doesn't want any part of it. Neither does Jack, for he refuses the caviar, traditionally the food of the rich, and is in quite a hurry to get out of the first class dinning room and back to steerage where the lower classes are.The distinction is really brought out when the ship is sinking. The third class passengers are locked below while the first class passengers are piling onto the lifeboats. Their belief that they are above the others goes to the point where they take off in lifeboats without the full capacity. The utter despicableness of this is fully realised when one sees all the dead floating in the Atlantic afterwards. The rich are only concerned for their own lives and the others just die for all they care. Only those who have money are important.The true evil of this comes out with the idea of women and children first. Even though they say that, there are men climbing onto the boats and looking for a way off the ship. These rich people are not interested in sacrifice, but in preserving their own lives. Cal, Rose's fianc√©, comes out even more wicked as he takes a lost girl only to use her to get onto a lifeboat, and when it looks as if the lifeboat will sink, he throws her away. He even beats people back into the ocean so as not to swamp his boat.Sacrifice in love is one that comes in through this movie, not greatly, but it is there. True love is when one is willing to sacrifice their lives to save others. We see that Jack constantly orders Rose onto the lifeboats, but Rose, more so, will not let him die alone and keeps on coming back to him. There seems the idea that love comes out of wanting to die together, but even so, we see an act of love, or sacrifice, at the end. The real idea of love as serving the one you love does not really come out, but that is an Americanism. Love is a special feeling, so they say, that happens between two people. Still, there is a lot of putting one's life on the line for the other in this movie, which is what love really is about.My only real gripe is the final scene in the movie, but that I ignored. It was just a stupid Americanism to give the movie a happy ending. If I were to rewrite the ending, then I would finish it with the Heart of the Sea sinking into the water.",7/10
A classic. Just incredible...,RagDolly,17 July 2010,"'Titanic' is a film so revered and praised that it can become tiresome and many choose to bash it just to spite its popularity but the truth is that 'Titanic' is a classic and is worthy of any praise it gets.Everybody knows how epic this film is. Everybody knows the extraordinary lengths that were gone to to make this such a memorable piece and everybody knows of the excellent performances given by Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio and the supporting cast. The incredible feat that this film achieves is, despite its huge scale, you can get entangled and wrapped up in each character. The simple love story of Jack and Rose is played out so intensely, it's beautiful and engaging to watch no matter how many times you've seen it before.What I love about this film is the fact that I can pick out plenty of cheesy moments and lines and many instances where Cameron has tried to over-dramatise an already tragic and epic story, as well as one ill-timed cut to the 'modern' day subplot, but I don't mind. I can get carried away in the story and love those moments as well.The truth is, this film is beautiful. The one-liners and funny moments early on that highlight the tragedy of the end, still touching and shocking despite the action and panic in them, are beaten only by the simplicity and beauty of the relationship between Jack and Rose. It sounds cheesy and clich√© but it is still as beautiful and romantic as ever and this film will always rate highly with me.",10/10
I wish that thing would sink already!,microbonnie,5 January 1999,"Titanic was one of the movies we walk into and know the basic outline of the plot before even taking our seat and watching the lights dim.  The Titanic is a legend, and it was an interesting idea to make a movie out of the true drama it was.  However, the poignant relationship between Jack and Rose failed to faze me at all; the whole ironic situation at the end affected me little.  I couldn't really empathize with such sappiness; I felt like the characters and even the whole 'tough love' story were unnecessarily cliche. Also, it took WAY too long.  Over an hour could have been cut while still making the point.  However, I think the scene with the musicians, and the scene with Andrew staring at his clock were quite sad and well-made; the rest of it is probably not worth the $2.00 rental fee.",4/10

"Not worthy of eleven Oscars, but still...",BluRaf185,22 December 2003,"Although ""Titanic"" was praised as one of the greatest movies of all time, it was also the costliest, which may have accounted for the eleven Oscars it received in 1998. ""Titanic"" was NOT the greatest movie of all time, but neither was it a complete disaster. The acting was atrocious, especially from the horribly miscast DiCaprio (who made up for this AND ""Romeo + Juliet"" in 2002's ""Catch Me if you Can""). Additionally, the love story was not very gripping. For me, the reason why I would have given Titanic an Oscar for Best Picture would be the last hour of the movie, which was breath-taking, tear-jerking, and very, very well done. The fact is, everyone knows how a movie called ""Titanic"" will end- the boat will sink, and people will die. But that last hour... it really made me feel as if I was on that ship, and I felt the horror around me as it sank.",No Rating
A Titanic loser...,Garys1266,8 October 1999,"My wife and I have just finished watching, or shall I say wasted our time watching this movie.  The script was obviously written or geared towards 13 and 14 year old girls.  A few observations:# 1  Why would a character as shallow and ignorant as the one Winslow portrayed fall for DeCaprio?  Should we believe that she would leave Zane's character who is a multi-millionaire?  The ignorant character that she portrayed would have never married a homeless painter.# 2  I have never seen so many stereotypes in one movie.  Rich snobbish people, drunken Irish and English people.# 3  Dolphins do not habitate the North Atlantic.# 4  When it's 30 degrees outside you can see your breath.# 5  When it's 30 degrees outside you can't survive in water for more than 3 minutes.# 6  This movie is a plain and simple cornball.

My wife and I watched it together on HBO the other evening and she concurs with me about the following summary.Why did James Cameron need 3 hours to tell this story?  This was one of the longest and most tedious films I have ever watched.  The contrived storyline was incredibly dull and unbelieveable.  Come on folks do you really think Winslet would have fallen in love with baby faced DiCaprio in real life? Like a shallow character like Winslet would have left a millionaire for a person that doesn't even have a home.  Also, DiCaprio would have been never invited to dinner from steerage.  Above all of that there was no chemistry that existed between DiCaprio and Winslet.  As far as the effects were concerned. I don't know what all the hype was as the effects looked very fake.  Granted I watched it on my TV on HBO and not at the movies mind you. Thank God I did watch it at home I would have been very angry at myself if my wife and I had spent 7 dollars to see this film.  I agree with the other negative comments on this board.  People who say this is good film, don't know what good film is.

"Not so good, but not that bad either",Petey-10,7 October 1999,"Titanic is a movie about a ship called Titanic and it takes place in 1912.Titanic leaves on a journey from England and is on the way to New York but it never gets there, because Titanic hits an iceberg and sinks.You all should know this story, because it happens to be a true story.But this movie tells also about two people falling in love in the ship.These two people are the rich Rose DeWitt Bukater, played by Kate Winslet and The poor Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio.And then there is also Rose's angry boyfriend Cal Hockley,played by Billy Zane.Gloria Stuart plays the old Rose.So everything goes pretty fine before Titanic hits the iceberg. Titanic was pretty successful movie,according to all the Oscars it got.But was Titanic worth every Oscars?Not necessarily.The topic of the movie was good and it touched many of us but the love story in Titanic was pretty boring, only the rest part, when Titanic is sinking, is more absorbing.Too long this movie is, I could say.But this works pretty well, anyway.",No Rating
*** 500th review / 100th Anniversary *** A night to remember (vhs) (screen),leplatypus,14 April 2012,"Well, as the Titanic's wreck, i never planned to a night like this. Titanic was released in 1997 and i didn't watch it in theater then. I think i must have said something like this: ""what's the point to see it as we already know how it ends!"". Not very bright but as shown in the movie, that's what life is about: to change for the better. Then, I caught it on TV at its maiden broadcast (in 1999) and i found it great indeed. But, seven years after, when i began writing reviews for IMDb in 2004, it wasn't still on my list because my first task was to review all my DVDs. So now, seven years later, i finally watched and reviewed them all and i intended that my 500th review marks my last ones (to discover what they are, just wait and read my 501th review coming next...).But, yesterday, Saturday 14th April 2012, exactly 100th year after its wreck, i admit that Titanic was heavy on my mind. For us westerners, Titanic was symbolic: the biggest machine man built never made it. I can't say if it's Babel Tower all over again but all its story leads to the unavoidable meeting of this ship and this iceberg. Its thousand victims are the first ranking peacetime tragedy in humankind. Indeed Titanic was indeed the summit because western civilization never got higher later. However, i still didn't want to see it that day on 3D screen because i planned to see it with my family next week when we will be again together (don't worry: i will travel by train!). But, as my fridge was empty and i had to go out, my idea was to go in a bookshop before and buy one good book about Titanic and keep the ticket as well. But there wasn't any special offers at the biggest one in Paris. Hopefully, i could try another one at Champs-Elys√©es that was also close to a food-store ... and a theater.incidentally, i just took a look at the programing and see that ""Titanic 3d"" was on screen one hour later at 20h40. So, if i would watch it now, it will be nearly at the same time that it sank one hundred years before! It was like all the victims resonated in me and i just bought the ticket and stepped into my first screen viewing of this titan!I think all the names the Titanic had can be also given to this movie. Wonderful, Modern, Outstanding and unsinkable as well! It's one of the best movie ever released and i'm sure it will be celebrated even a century away!I can't name another movie that blends so much history, romance and technology! Cameron and his crew gives so much to get us on the boat and in the same time crafts a powerful love story. If a lot have been said about DiCaprio, Winslet is phenomenal as well. In all cases, it's moving to see a such strong love and what they shared for hours in this flamboyant daylight before the wreck worths lifetime. But the story is also a sincere classes critic and it's good to have a writer/director to give voices to the poors or the women conditions. It's also a formidable testimony of courage for all those braves who stayed on board to help and to finally wait for death (her captain, her designer, Gugenheim, ...)Well, there's a lot to experience in such compartmentalized place and it has been anointed with a last grace: Horner's score is one of the best heard ever and really gives a beating heart to the movie.The final reunion with Jack waiting Rose at the staircase, surrounded with all those brave souls is a definitive moment of filmmaking and it's another memory of a vibrant final moment that I keep in mind (among ""Blade Runner"",""Godfather III"", ""Knowing"" and ""Blood Diamonds"").Well, i take a look at the hour: 2h20 in the morning on 15 April 2012. At this time, Titanic went exactly deep under and actually, i must say that i'm all frozen as well because i wanted to write that review windows open to let the chilly April night enter my room and experience a bit the cold that they faced a century ago...Well, i suppose i wouldn't be there for her 200th birthday but i hope that my heart will go on for hundred reviews like those...RIP",10/10
Contrived Tosh!,Rufus-15,13 November 1998,What a load of hype about nothing very much. The people who made this movie were so engrossed in special effects and massive budgets that they neglected to notice the cliched story line and consequently missed the opportunity to highlight the real tragedy of the event - that a few minor differences in circumstance would have altered the result of that fateful night entirely. What a waste!,1/10
I was Touched,fwgrhouse,9 June 2006,"When I was in the third grade I learned about the Titanic. The moment after I first heard of it, I immediately got interested in it. Then awhile later, I heard of the movie. I wanted to see it, so I rented it and watched it with my parents (they already saw it so I knew how it ended) and when it was done, I was crying. I'm 15 right now and when I see it I still at times hold back tears. I couldn't imagine anyone who wouldn't be touched by this. The plot is excellent, the actors play the roles very well, and the special effects are excellent. It also shows that the disaster could have been less tragic if they put more lifeboats and put more people in them. This is a film which is a defenet must-see film.",10/10
SUPREMELY WONDERFUL!,eamon-hennedy,27 October 2003,"James Cameron really knows how to put on a show. T-2, The Abyss, True Lies and Aliens, all of his films have been hugely enjoyable, rich in epic scope and emotional flavor. Whether it be science fiction or in this case an historical disaster film, he really knows how to create rich epic entertainment and with Titanic he has probably made his finest film artistically. Sure, there are  many who don't like the film , historians will go 'tut-tut' which they always do anyway at any film based on historical fact, but Cameron makes his interpretation of the Titanic disaster work so well, mainly because he knows how to tell a story really well and he is a master at creating suspense in his action sequences.The first half of Titanic in undeniably moving. The love story between Jack and Rose may have every cliche in the book (the jealous fiance, the evil mother in law, the tug of love between lover and family) but let me tell you Cameron can make these cliches really work here. The epic scale puts it above sheer soap opera and with fantastic performances from Winslet, Zane and even DiCaprio, Cameron really makes the love story work from a story telling point of view and a visual one. The way he presents the first kiss on the bow, to the drawing of a nude rose through to the love scene, Cameron makes his finest film, and if this were just a period love piece it would be enough, but as this is about the sinking of the Titanic he has more aces up his sleeve and he creates the most moving motion picture in many a decade. Not since the days of David Lean has a love story been presented in such a way, and when that iceberg comes, Cameron mixes love story and historical disaster in the most fantastic way which ensured that audiences responded in their droves.Sure this is not great art, it is a Hollywood blockbuster, one, like Gladiator (it too a fantastic film) that takes the audience back to the good old days when big budgeted blockbusters had a great plot as well as superb special effects, and with Cameron at the helm we are getting the best of both worlds. All of this culminates in some of the most moving scenes in a mainstream Hollywood film I have ever seen. They are not manipulative. They are well written.This is a superb film on every level. Well done James, you have done it again.",10/10

reiewv,ucapoor,20 September 2016,"Like a great iron Sphinx on the ocean floor, the Titanic faces still toward the West, interrupted forever on its only voyage. We see it in the opening shots of ""Titanic,"" encrusted with the silt of 85 years; a remote-controlled TV camera snakes its way inside, down corridors and through doorways, showing us staterooms built for millionaires and inherited by crustaceans.Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well. The technical difficulties are so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion. I found myself convinced by both the story and the saga. The setup of the love story is fairly routine, but the payoff--how everyone behaves as the ship is sinking--is wonderfully written, as passengers are forced to make impossible choices. Even the villain, played by Zane, reveals a human element at a crucial moment (despite everything, damn it all, he does love the girl).The image from the Titanic that has haunted me, ever since I first read the story of the great ship, involves the moments right after it sank. The night sea was quiet enough so that cries for help carried easily across the water to the lifeboats, which drew prudently away. Still dressed up in the latest fashions, hundreds froze and drowned. What an extraordinary position to find yourself in after spending all that money for a ticket on an unsinkable ship.www.flickstree.com has provided us a platform for all the movie lovers to get them movie online for free",3/10
Lame.,AllenTehAwesome,5 August 2007,"Seriously, most over-rated film ever made. It's not so much that it's a particularly bad film, it's just not that great of one. When it came out about ten years ago, I thought it sucked. Most would attribute this to the fact that I was just a small child with little taste in anything. Which is true. When I was young, if there wasn't plenty of violence and cool things in a movie, I hated it.However, watching this again as a supposed adult, I find that young me was quite right. Titanic was a borefest. It was one lame line after the other. It was just a fictional princess-falls-in-love-with-a-peasant story set during a historical event. What garbage. It didn't even stand out as a love story. It was bland and uneventful. I don't see why it got so much praise. It was such a mediocre piece of work, yet it's supposedly one of the best films of all time. This piece of mediocrity receives such praise while well thought out action, horror, and thriller films get tossed aside and labeled as distasteful exploitation films.Really, I'm not all about action and violence, but lets give credit and money where they're due. And neither are due here. This was easily the most bland movie ever made. I'd relate watching this to getting jabbed in the eyeballs with butcher knives repetitively for three hours. However, that would actually be more exciting than watching Titanic.",2/10

"Oh, my god... How is it possible to make this crap?",stonehorn,23 November 2004,"That's it; Titanic is (next to House of 1000 Corpses) officially the worst movie ever made.. How is it possible to make a movie about a ship sinking and focus so little on the actual sinking of the ship.. Jesus, the only important thing seems to be the relationship between the extremely gay Leonardo Di Caprio and the chubby Kate Winslet.. I mean; come on! There were other people there as well!!! They actually died and didn't get to tell their so-called ""moving story"" to others.. A bit of focus on that would be nice!Only women in the age 8-15 years old can seriously enjoy Titanic because of the rubbish acting, the unfathomably bad story and the ridiculously dull ending... However, I haven't actually seen Titanic, because I'd rather be forced to watch a brick wall for a good two hours instead, but these things I've said in this comment I can tell anyway.. And those of you who disagree with me only do because you're in love with Di Caprio... Fact.",1/10
"Flawless, brilliant film.",theriaasucks,4 February 2006,"Titanic is one of the very most well made movies I have ever seen. You can debate about it's greatness, but it surely is not bad.I saw Titanic on VHS right when it came out, I was about seven or eight. I didn't really pay attention, but I liked the sinking part. So it was right after Christmas last year, and I was flipping through channels and saw that this movie just started on HBO. Hearing a lot about this film and having nothing better to do at the time, I thought I'd watch it. Not remembering it at all, and watching about thirty minutes in, I didn't really expect the ship to sink. I never thought about it, that is pretty awesome because the people on the ship didn't expect it. This movie does a very good job of drawing you into the main characters. You know Jack and Rose are going to end up together, but at the same time it also gives you a feeling that it's not going to happen. Watching the movie, you know they want each other. It finally happens, and you really start to get into the movie. Like I said before, you don't really wait for the ship to hit the iceburg, you don't think about it. Then, it finally happens that one night. The makers of the movie did a very good job on focusing on other characters meeting their fate while still concentrating on Jack and Rose. The sinking part is amazing. It does an unbelievable job of showing you how horrific and huge it really was. It also did a great job of showing you the event wasn't over once the ship went under the surface. The very end scene, when Jack and Rose meet in heaven, is brilliant.This movie is incredibly well made, and for certain not bad as many close minded people think.Watch the movie with an open mind, and you will not be disappointed. Many people watch the movie with a closed mind expecting it to be ""gay"", and find excuses while watching it. This movie is very, very well made, flawless, and excellent. One of the very best modern films.",10/10
One of the best 20 movies of all time,mrbluto,20 June 2001,"I kept putting off seeing this movie with my wife because I labeled it a chick movie,I was so very wrong, Titanic has well written characters and a story even though we knew the ending keeps you on the edge of your seat through the entire three hours. There really was a Rose on the Titanic. The critics of this movie only have to look at the fact that is made almost 2 billion dollars world wide when no movie have ever made more than 900 million,this Titanic amount of cannot be just from teenage girls. Titanic is as close to a perfect movie as has ever been made. I give it a 10 and put it in my top 20 with the likes of the Godfather and jaws.",10/10
Romeo and Juliet Type of Movie,shelbythuylinh,5 December 2021,Really the movie is about rich vs poor. And not looking and making on that over in the assumptions on people like Rose's family did on Jack Dawson.But he was a smart and happy go lucky kind of guy who traveled. Still Leo and Kate had great chemistry. But it is the actress Kathy Bates that steals the movie there. And how her unsinkable Molly Brown is someone that is not to be messed with. Billy Zane as forced upon fiance of Rose to make sure her family has the rich lifestyle there despite it being against her will.It is about the ill fated ship of 1912 there that should had not been unsinkable there. But it was no thanks to an iceberg.Shows the ship being torn apart not just on the large part but that over in all over the inside and out. Everybody almost dies on the ship and how they tried to survive as really it is due to overconfidence there.,8/10
"The REAL POINT of this movie, if you think about it, was the ""truth"" of this tragedy !",peterwhite311,26 January 2006,"I've seen ""Titanic"" many times now, and I get teary-eyed still because I TRY (without much effort) to imagine the actual people this happened to in 1912 -- the very rich, the immigrants down below, the SMUG SELF-PROCLAIMED ""unsinkable ship"" propaganda, and the tragedy at the end as the ship begins to fall apart.It remains an ""interesting"" movie because of the mix of recent ""real time footage"" intermingled with the love story. But, as the Celine Dion song implies (""My heart will go on and on""), there was a VERY REAL TRAGEDY of these ""poor"" people trapped in the middle of a dark, freezing ocean, with no ""high tech"" to help save them. The terrifying last half of the movie, with terrified people running back and forth trying to escape the inevitable REALLY GETS TO ME the more I see this movie. Tragedies happen every day in the world, but this was 1912.Don't know what else to say - except that I DO GET TEARY-EYED at the ending. These poor defenseless people -- it could have been any one of us, then or now (if you believe in reincarnation, which I DO NOT !).

"""Good Will Hunting"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" got robbed",FiveSecondStare,6 May 1999,"O.K., don't get misled by the one-line summary, I thought ""Titanic"" was a descent movie, but in no way was it the best film of the year, not even close. Let's face it, if DiCaprio isn't in the cast, this movie doesn't break the records. The performances were all half-way decent at best (I could have played Jack, it was that difficult of a part). But the special effects were nice. The plot was textbook romance and there was nothing surprising, even when Jack died. All in all, this movie was ok. I give it a 6 out of 10. If you want to see a real Cameron movie see ""True Lies"". That's a movie that has got it all. Fun, action, comedy, and a surprise here and there. Finally the main reason this movie could have been better is if the screenplay was better. ""Good Will Hunting"" won for best screenplay in '97 and they deserved it a lot more. A good movie, but ladies, lets just leave it at that.",6/10
Great movie!,barbaralgeorge,3 August 2009,"This film is about a love triangle that happens on the Titanic. The Titanic, the ship of dreams, is also known as ""The Unsinkable"". Rose leaves her rich fianc√© Caledon Hockley for this poor artist, Jack. However, the Titanic collides with an Iceberg and sinks on April 15th, 1912 at 2:20 in the morning. Surprisingly, Jack dies and Rose survives. Eighty-four years later, Rose tells the story about her life on Titanic to her grand daughter and friends and explains the first sight of Jack-how she fell in love and how they fought for survival.The theme of the movie is that love is worth more than material things. Cameron uses real actors that some people believe is based on a true story. Written in 1912, the dialogue is appropriate for the time period. Located in the Atlantic Ocean, this movie was actually based on some real occurrences. The film's soundtrack made the movie more enjoyable, especially the song by Celine Dion ""My Heart Will Go On"".",10/10
The Viewer's Heart is a Deep Ocean of Secrets !,elshikh4,27 August 2009,"So this is maybe the billion review about (Titanic). The first thing I must say is about me being so irritated of this movie. Surely, when you hear about one movie as the greatest, know that it hit all the records, then get to see it to discover that it's another movie, and how there were many better movies that didn't get 10 % of the popularity that that one had, then you must be as irritated as me!Most of the characters are fine, but not in a capable drama. Let's face it; (James Cameron) wanted mainly a big production disaster movie, not a romantic epic. The start is too long and boring. ""The women's heart is a deep ocean of secrets"" aside from being the movie's only interesting line, it's not that interesting in the first place. Sometimes the man's heart is a deep ocean of secrets too!It's more than clear that there was kind of disharmony between the 2 leads. A lot of viewers, I'm one of them, saw that (Kate Winslet) had more presence than (Leonardo DiCaprio), and looked a bit older than him, which ruined their on-screen chemistry. Speaking of ruining, I hated the nude scene. It's not only about me despising nudity in the first place; it's also about it as something that ruined the romantic sense of the movie thereafter.I can't stand the fact that (Rose) is the one who killed (Jack), when she left him in the icy water. Why she didn't give him a part of raft, or got to be on it for some, then (Jack) for some?? SO SELFISH! And yes, the tragedy of ""My Hard Will Go on""! For anyone who didn't live 1997, that was a complete nightmare, pals. This song was everywhere, if you didn't find it in radio, then it would meet you in TV, and when you got rid of it, then it would hunt you down successfully from the cars' audio system!I didn't satisfy with the Oscars as well. The hyped persona of the movie mirrored itself highly in the Academy Award's night. But it didn't win the script's award. In fact, it couldn't.Though, I liked some nice bits; like how (Jack) is the youthful lively modernism of this stiff world. Or the part of the musicians playing the music while everything is dying, simply because the artist, the real one, has no message in life but to play his music, to the end of life. And I liked the final scene / Rose's dream where her love goes on and on. But, to tell you the truth, it was one of the excellent endings which you wish another, more deep and satisfying, movie for it!If something about it is really great, else the global mania, so it is its CGI. (Cameron) dreamed and fulfilled perfectly in that area. Anyhow, this is a very good movie after all. An action fare, a powerful disaster flick, with some romantic moments. It got a pretty old love story, yet with a lovely charisma as a whole. But, it only doesn't work for me. Sometimes, it's all the time, you have another taste.If you looked to the whole history of cinema, you'll find many movies, like (Titanic) or better, whether they were meant to be big hits or just truthful works; they didn't make it to be the most successful ever. It's just a certain moment when the audience needs all what one movie has. However, the audience's necessities remain vague, unpredictable and change from time to time. And whatever the intelligence of any moviemaker is, no one will ever know what exactly these necessities may be in one moment on big scale. Or what the movie to fulfill them can be. Otherwise all the movies out there will be another (Titanic)!(Titanic - 1997) is the absolute chance to explore the mood of the viewer of the twentieth century's end. It presented a love story in the middle of a fallen world / the ship itself. As if the huge, rich and proud civilization is in its way to a near inevitable collapse by hitting an iceberg; where the coldness of all the humans, aka: the icebergs, will kill them eventually, and the only survivor will be love. So the necklace, that somehow can survive too, while representing all the material values; will equal nothing in the end. Notice that the end isn't happy; that's uncommon, as this true lover got no place in our fatally hectic world.It wasn't a coincidence that (Titanic) made it big. It is a clever movie that came in the right moment. But in another moment, that clever movie could've made it to be a mighty flop. It is the viewer's heart which's a deep ocean of secrets. And some movies come in some time, precisely ""in time"", to unlock it.",6/10
Over rated,destiny_west,4 March 2023,"I will cop a lot of hate for this, but Titanic is one of the most over-rated films I can possibly think of.The fictional story of Jack and Rose set upon the tragic true life disaster of the sinking of the Titanic was over blown and in my opinion boring.I absolutely adore Kate Winslet as an actress, and as stunning as she was as Rose, she would have eaten little boy Leo alive.The fact that James Cameron went so far as to show horrific details that we knew happened that we don't need to see, I found incredibly over the top on his part and not necessary.I really have nothing redeeming to say about this film at all.",5/10
"A great epic created by the determination and perfectionism of a director, which shows an almost impossible romance and instigates reflections, analysis and lots of emotions",fernandoschiavi,30 December 2022,"Over its three-hour runtime, Titanic represents a gigantic cinematic achievement. And while the first half takes on the responsibility of establishing the presence of all the faces that we will follow, their relationships and the tragedy that is announced, the second part is responsible for the definitive test of how much we have been involved up to that point and how far Cameron's heavy hand with his team was justified. The whole act of the ship succumbing after colliding with an iceberg takes about an hour or so of projection, and with all this time in hand, Cameron elaborates his opera of despair, tears and the true portrait of the dimension of the facts, of solidarity vs. Need for survival, greed vs man's unpreparedness and overconfidence. ""Not even God could sink that ship"", says someone at one point, and Cameron is keen to keep this line of dialogue as an uncomfortable irony about the representation of power that the Titanic gave to those responsible and how their fate symbolized their downfall. And how several lives had to pay together for it. Cameron does not make this explicit in dialogues, but through situations while the ship sinks that make it impossible for the public to remain impassive in the face of the fact that, yes, the fate of the RMS Titanic could have been different.Much of Cameron's own passion (slightly escaping from the term ""obsession""), of course, was materialized in a palpable way on the screen, especially in the initial shock with all the perfectionism in the smallest details about the realistic reconstruction of the ship, something that gave Cameron a long time of research, whether on the architecture of the ship, on the division of classes and on legendary figures from that event who mark their presence or not in Cameron's vision. Titanic already proves to be a courageous positioning film when its script takes place within this novel that embraces the corny and the improbable and makes the shipwreck its backdrop to link these two lines. The ship is almost a silent and threatening character that is there to test the limits of the overwhelming feelings between Jack and Rose.And Cameron, skillfully, makes this unlikely romantic portrayal his main force to make us laugh, cry, move and cheer for an undetectable three hours of projection. Jack and Rose formed their relationship during the 4 days the ship was in the Atlantic, but we treated the couple as if they had known each other for a long time. The director's patience and richness is commendable for establishing the mutual interest between the characters, working on dialogues and looks that exemplify, little by little, what Jack and Rose feel. There is the first exchange of looks, the initial barbs between the couple, and then the exchange of smiles and furtive encounters that denote the emergence and growth of that passion. And not only that, there's also the presence of Rose's villainous fianc√©, Cal (Billy Zane) and his mother Ruth (Frances Fisher), both petty, aristocratic and pompous fellows who will be immediately against Rose's approach to the third-grade boy. Manichaeism, in theory, is formed, but as Titanic deconstructs itself, what seems ""black and white"" on paper becomes a palpable mosaic of good guys and bad guys that, when we realize it, we are already involved.But Cameron also has a notable respect for the historical fact itself and all its tragic representation, walking with his camera in a take that reveals all the majesty of the ship and, inside, the prevalence of a hierarchy between the richest and the poorest. . The different treatment between the classes is perfectly represented from the ascent to the ship until its entire sinking, where we see that even in the imminent tragedy, the hierarchy remains about who should live and die. Cameron is punctual without being didactic, and thereby enriches the historical balance that is Titanic. The sequences in which the camera ""flies"" over the replica of the Titanic made at Cameron's request, showing its full size are breathtaking. The art direction and scenography are exquisite, as well as the photography. The sound (especially if you're in a cinema that has digital sound) is an independent part of the story, alternating deafening moments with others of absolute calm. In this regard, I must particularly emphasize the moment of the collision with the iceberg and the sequence in the engine room.And even in the destruction of the ship before our eyes, it is not there that we find certainty for Cameron's placements behind the cameras, but we only attest to how much this is a refined filmmaker, who reached his apex here about what to know exactly what to do, how to do it and what it would take to get to that result. Cameron had already proven to be a skilled manipulator of special and digital effects with both The Terminator or even his Aliens, the Rescue, and even after Titanic, cinema evolves a lot in possibilities, probabilities and technological advancement. But remember that 20 years have just passed, and even in a thorough analysis, it is quite difficult (daring to say, impossible) to find a visual spectacle like the one provided by Titanic. The magnitude of everything is indescribable, whether for the destruction of the sets while the icy waters of the Atlantic destroy the rooms and deform the ship, the shots with an uncountable number of extras running and fighting for their lives, the legendary and remarkable moments like the couple of elderly people embracing in bed, or the orchestra of violinists, or the long-awaited scene where the ship breaks in half. Everything is eye-popping and impressing the senses. A complex tragedy relived almost in real time.And by wrapping his story of love and tragedy within this classic Shakespearean aura, there was no way Cameron could dispense with names in his cast that would bring the breath and embrace necessary for his characters to be pulsating enough to hook audiences, or else all the clich√©s. Together would shoot themselves in the foot and would sacrifice involvement. And when we look back, we wonder if either Cameron really was lucky, or even to assemble his cast the director had vision. Kate Winslet was already on the back of a notable Oscar nomination for Sense and Sensibility, and in the role of the determined Rose she proved to the world what an actress of rich nuances she was, nuances that can be noted with pleasure in Rose's internal conflicts that Winslet exemplifies through expressions that vary between fear, despair (she is being forced by her mother to remain engaged to Cal) and the certainty of what her heart wants. In her counterpoint, the now deceased Gloria Stuart embodies Rose with more than 100 years of life, and in the measly minutes in which she appears to narrate her story on the ship, she conveys a truth in her face about the facts as if she had really gone through everything. That (and regrettably, the actress lost her Oscar that year to Kim Basinger in Los Angele: Confidential).DiCaprio, instantly cemented as a youthful symbol (the actor was a measly 23 years old at the time) for his portrayal of Jack Dawson, takes the position of that youthful, penniless but hopeful, passionate and sensitive soul, the perfect recipe for May your face conquer hearts. Billy Zane, who could have received more attention at that year's awards, perfectly balances Cal's villainy, who, deep down, is just another man who doesn't want to be passed over by the female figure he was promised. Kathy Bates captivates as the legendary Molly Brown (despite the character not receiving a worthy outcome for herself, something confessed by the actress herself years later), Frances Fisher stamps on her face the desperation of losing all her money if Rose does not firm her commitment to Cal, and among all the other names, Bill Paxton and Victor Garber are moving with their personal conflicts directly involving the ship.Along with the film's explosion in theaters, Celine Dion's theme song for the film, My Heart Will Go On, flooded radio for an impressive period, breaking records and accumulating for itself several parodies and references in other outlets over the years. The composer James Horner himself, now deceased, takes advantage of his nuances, chords and evocations to compose the striking soundtrack responsible for so many tears. And detail: Cameron was not in favor of any song within the film, so Horner composed the song in secret along with Will Jennings so that Celine could record it. Cameron only agreed to use it after listening to the song several times and coming to the conclusion that a potentially successful song could calm the spirits of studio executives. The success proves to us that the beautiful song is indispensable to Titanic's popularity.""Titanic"" is almost an opera. It is a testimony against greed, against unpreparedness and the lack of solidarity among men. It is also the record of one of humanity's greatest accidents, something so memorable that it should never be repeated. The genius of James Cameron, the maestro of this magnitude, was to be able to handle all possible clich√©s and make them work in his favor. The characters, for example, are completely Manichaean, with no middle ground. The sea is always calm, the sky is constantly blue. Everything is beautiful, beautiful, dazzling. And yet dangerous, frightening, deadly. We get so wrapped up in the scale of facts and facts that we ignore every slip up. And even the end, sugary to the extreme, sends us to the inevitable cry. Impossible to remain impassive, however unlikely it may be.""Titanic"" is a great epic, made possible by the determination and perfectionism of a director, which portrays an almost impossible romance and instigates reflections and analyzes as exciting as the emotion caused by the film.",9/10
Look at it for what it is and not for what it isn't,dee.reid,13 April 2002,"It has now been five years since ""Titanic"" was released into theaters and broke box office records by taking in more than $500 million worldwide (due largely to teenage girls). The story soon became familiar to everyone: poor boy Leonardo DiCaprio falls in love with rich girl Kate Winslet. ""Titanic"" won eleven out of fourteen Academy Award nominations, including best picture and best director: James Cameron. This movie made Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet box office stars. Leonardo DiCaprio became the biggest teen heartthrob since Corey Feldman while Kate Winslet became the hottest woman in Hollywood. This for me, was most evident when these two kids in my sixth grade class made a wallpaper (it was non-nude) of her on the teacher's computer. However, even with all the positive press this movie was getting, some people felt that ""Titanic"" was not all that it had been hyped up to be. Those people felt that ""Titanic"" was really nothing special, the acting especially that of Leonardo DiCaprio totally sucked, and some people claimed that the best part of this whole movie was when Kate Winslet stripped naked before having her youth immortalized as one of the girls in Jack's book. Even after hearing all of these negative comments about this film, I did not let them have an impact on my viewing of it. First, I think we all have to remember that this movie is coming from James Cameron, the man who brought us ""The Terminator"", ""Aliens"", ""The Abyss"", produced ""Point Break"" and wrote ""Strange Days"", ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", ""True Lies"", and TV's ""Dark Angel"". This movie made James Cameron probably one of the most successful directors in Hollywood. Even before ""Titanic,"" James Cameron had never ever really experienced that much success with any of his previous films.Second, look at this film for what is, which is a fictional love story in a historical setting, not a historical romance. Third, this is the most expensive movie Hollywood has ever made, costing $200 million to make. Director James Cameron risked his entire career as well as sinking Paramount studios into bankruptcy. It was a VERY, VERY big gamble that fortunately for James Cameron and Paramount studios, would pay off.Fourth, I'm a guy. I don't care to see Leonardo DiCaprio and I didn't watch this movie just to see Kate Winslet strip either, but I watched ""Titanic"" because I'm a fan of James Cameron and I have been since ""The Terminator"". Fifth, I know that this is one of those movies that when there is a wide range of comments about it, that it is best view it for yourself and then make your own judgment. That being said, I've watched ""Titanic"" at least ten times since 1998 and I still don't know whether or not I hate it or like it. But I give ""Titanic"" an eight out of ten based squarely on my own viewings and not popular opinion.",10/10
bad movie,jbt136,22 April 2002,"this movie is awful. its only good because leo dies and the special effects are decent but just because it did really well at the box office because 100 teenage girls saw it 10,000 times, so i have to say it was horrible. the story was awful and i just wanted to see the effects, they didnt need to waste the first video on their ""love"" over the course of a month... what garbage",1/10

Famous ocean liner sunk by fatal flaw: its script,blueangel-76133,25 October 2019,"I'd like to proudly join the ranks of the minority who found this film to be a tedious, silly, childish serving of ridiculous pap interesting only to juvenile sensibilities. Aside from the presence of the genuinely talented DiCaprio and some admittedly visually striking scenes of the boat's sinking, the film (as any film is) is absolutely mortally impaired by Cameron's Jack and Jill simple script of poor but good boy loves rich but trapped in evil high society girl who are then tragically parted by cruel fate while their love is still young, sweet and fresh. If only genuine real life were actually like this perhaps films like this could be enjoyable, but any sensitive, perceptive mature adult knows that (perhaps unfortunately) that it just ain't so. Cameron is certainly, though, an extremely talented action director with the directing credits of Aliens and Terminator 2 to his name, he just shouldn't write his own scripts as in this department his insight and understanding of the depth and complexity of the genuine human experience is seriously lacking. I'll just keep rewatching Aliens and T2 and hoping that Cameron hires Frank Darabont (who wrote The Shawshank Redemption) to write his scripts, or stays firmly in the director's chair.",1/10
Good,AAdaSC,7 September 2009,"The film starts with the search for a valuable diamond that is presumed to have been lost when the Titanic sank. An old survivor, Rose (Gloria Stuart) contacts the team who are searching through the Titanic on the ocean-bed. She sits down and recounts her memories of the journey that she had and the love that she found with Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio)........oh yeah...........the ship sinks........I began watching the film determined not to cry but it all got too much and I started to well up as the credits started and the film began! Although, I think it's a good film, I feel I should mention the following points. Its way too long - scenes are drawn out and this had the effect of detaching me from the action and so lessening my emotional involvement. I thought that Kate Winslet as ""Rose"" and Leonardo DiCaprio were good in the lead roles but Kate was too much of a woman. She is meant to be a 16 year old. She was far too mature. This made Jack seem a bit too boyish for her, although his look is probably right considering that Kate is meant to be 16. Having said that, Winslet's facial expressions are very good and she draws you in to what she is feeling - she conveys the despair of the situation very well. She's also pretty good with an axe! I felt that DiCaprio was likable despite his constant optimism and the rest of the cast were good.Thank goodness that the Titanic sank and gave us such a wonderful tragedy.",7/10
see this one on the big screen!!!,mattkratz,5 September 2000,"This is one of those movies where the cinematography is one of the main highlightes. The ship sinking is awesome and best seen in either the big screen or in widescreen format. That scene and the budding romance between Leo & kate make up the vast majority of this film-about 97% of it. The movie certainly made a heartthrob of Leo! See this movie if just for the ship sinking part. Young & the Restless fans can spot Eric Braeden (Victor) as John J.

One can only conclude that anyone who really loves films will hate it.",1/10
"Megalomaniac and melodramatic ... but oh, so imposing",fredrikgunerius,1 March 2023,"It seemed only reasonable that when James Cameron - at the height of his success - was to make a film about Titanic, a ship borne by megalomania, his approach would be similarly megalomaniac. Overwhelming and innovative special effects, an unscrupulous running time, and a classic, over-sized romance with all the mushiest ingredients: poor vs. Rich, working class vs. Aristocracy, old vs. New world-order, love's conquest of superficial values such as status, appearance and etiquette. And as the HMS Titanic disappears into the Atlantic void, it pulls all those old-fashioned, old-worldly values down with it. And what survives, in the wake of the romantic tragedy, is youthfulness, hope and equality - personified by Rose, a formative representative of America and the new social order.As always with Cameron's films, there is self-indulgence and badly hidden patriotism lurking underneath the surface. And the ridiculous in-your-face attitude of his scientists and the contemporary Rose is something we'll always have to bear over with when it comes to Cameron films. But in the case of Titanic, these must be considered insignificant details, nothing but wrapping for his wonderfully atmospheric, extremely detailed presentation of the ship itself and its one and only cross-atlantic journey. It is in the portrayal of the famous tragedy that Cameron's talent as a storyteller and filmmaker comes into its own, and coupled with the remarkable technical achievement of the film - a department in which Cameron was in a league of his own in the 1990s - this elevates Titanic to one of the most imposing films of the period, easily overshadowing the somewhat melodramatic nature of the romance and the simplistic dichotomy of good and bad. Rarely has an historical event been filmed in such a devoted and realistic way, and although Titanic isn't the most creative or artistic entry in James Cameron's impressive catalogue, it might still well be remembered as his magnum opus.",8/10

Leonardo and Kate really shine!,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,17 November 2005,"Wow! Leonardo and Kate really shine as a starving artist and a beautiful rich girl! I thought that Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) looked very beautiful in the dress she wore when she first met Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio). The one person I really couldn't stand was Cal (Billy Zane). This was because he was very conceited, arrogant, and controlling of the woman he loved. Plus, he chased after Jack and Rose, attempting to kill them. If I were Rose, I would have told Cal that the wedding's off. Other than that, this film really touched me and made me feel good. In conclusion, to all you Leonardo DiCaprio or Kate Winslet fans who haven't seen TITANIC, go to the video store, buy it or rent it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it, or your money back.",9/10
A true James Cameron masterpiece,davispittman,8 March 2015,"Titanic is for sure one of the most beloved films ever made, especially by the Academy in the year it came out. I believe it is very deserving of the many praises it has received over the years. i know there are people that claim it's terrible and i think it's mostly guys who roll their eyes at the romance involved. Ok so i think the acting from the very talented cast is well done. Winslet and DiCaprio are both doing their absolute best here, which is great because they really are two very gifted actors. i believe their love story because of the chemistry between them. I think the drawing scene and the car scene are both very beautifully done, handled well. The expressions on their faces portray real love and affection, but they both at the same time show a sense of vulnerability too. The other actors are very convincing as well, one that deserves praise is Kathy Bates, who plays Molly Brown. She had a great, believable energy about her, and she provides some fun comedic relief too. Gloria Stuart is so amazing here, she might be my favorite member of the cast, it may be a tie between her and DiCaprio because they're both so great. The visual effects in this film are just flat out incredible! They still hold up today and they are so realistic and breathtaking to watch. The soundtrack is great and I think it fits the film's tone. Overall, James Cameron knows what he's doing and he has people around him who also know what they're doing, so it results in a wildly entertaining, smart film, one that I will forever call a masterpiece.",10/10
What was all of the hype about?,wolters,20 September 1998,"I was one of the ""few"" who didn't see Titanic in the theaters. I am not sure why. I am a big fan of James Cameron movies. Having enjoyed Aliens, The Abyss and The Terminator movies, I really thought I would enjoy Titanic. First of all, I really admired the set design and the special effects. Those alone really made the movie for me. I felt the acting was sub-par compared to most Cameron movies and the dialogue was very dull at times. The sub plots didn't interest me at all. Also, why was the movie given a PG-13 rating? One of the sub plots was about nude drawings and showing someone nude while they are being drawn? Couldn't they have come up with something more family oriented than a nude drawing recovered? Call me old fashioned, but I can't understand why this movie made so much money and it contained nude scenes? I wanted to see a movie that dealt with the events leading up to the wreck and didn't expect those scenes plus pre-marital sex! I am not sure how much of the film was the truth and what was embellished? I know it seems like I am hung up on this, but it took me off guard. To continue, I felt that the sinking scenes were well done and it continues to show how much ""disaster"" realism that James Cameron likes to include in his movies.

I believe that this movie is horribly overrated.  I am not saying that I did not enjoy the movie, because I did.  It was a very interesting account of the lives of two central people aboard the Titanic, one of the worst disasters in history.  The real excitement hit when the boat hit the iceberg.  The movie kept my attention from then on out.  Many people say that this movie is the best movie ever created.  I beg to differ.  In my opinion, the best movie ever made is Gone With the Wind.  You just can't compare to such an epic.  Titanic doesn't even come close.  When you really boil the movie down, it merely is a dressed up romance with an action/adventure tagged onto it.  It is a very exciting movie, but I prefer to see it only once, and it does not compare to the classic old movies which have stood the test of time.",6/10

Good,pimpdawg55566678,2 January 2006,"Titanic is not without serious flaws such as bad dialouge and stuff. I see many people just love to bash the movie. Well they seem to forget that for six months this movie was all anyone could talk about. It was a phenomenon that took the world by storm. I remember I saw it with my parents and there was not a dry eye in the theater not one by the end of the movie. The first hour and half is slow but works it is a good love story which is obviously half the reason why the film succeeded because women loved it. I mean it is a very tragic story. By the second half however we see some of the best scenes in movie history. The audience literally feels what it was like to be on that ship while it was sinking. It is a terrifying hour as we watch people drown, die, we see kids being separated from their fathers. We see the sheer ruthless ness of the officers as they try to keep order on the ship. We see the third class get locked down below the ship like animanls not even given a chance to survive. The effects were excellent. The scenes that were effect shots were so perfect that you could not tell they were effect shots.To bash this film and say it is horrible is flat wrong. The movie works and I will be the first to say gender does not matter because I am a guy and I think the movie was pretty good.",8/10
The storyline is generally overwrought romance,steiner-sam,15 February 2023,"It's a disaster movie set in April 1912 and 1996 on board the ill-fated maiden voyage of the Titanic. Against the backdrop of the disaster, it follows the relationship of a poor upper-class woman, her wealthy fianc√©e, and a poor American sketch artist she meets on the ship.In the opening scenes set in 1996, we see Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and his treasure-hunting crew search the wreck of the Titanic for a valuable pendant presumed to have gone down with the ship. However, instead of a pendant, they discover a nude drawing of a young woman wearing the jewel. The news story of their finding puts them in touch with a 100-year-old woman, Rose Dawson Calvert (Gloria Stuart). This woman then tells the story of the Titanic's voyage.Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) is an American teenager engaged to Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), the wealthy son of a steel baron who can't see past his own ego and mistreats Rose. Rose is traveling with her mother, Ruth (Frances Fisher), who is desperate for the marriage to preserve her status. Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a poor artist who is only on the ship because he won a ticket in a poker game. He notices Rose immediately and talks her out of suicide after a terrible run-in with Cal.The film then follows the deepening relationship of Rose and Jack, as well as the strong reaction by Cal and Ruth. In the meantime, the events that eventually overwhelm the Titanic occur in the background. In the end, we learn how Rose survived and the fates of Jack, Cal, and Rose, as well as the priceless pendant.The technical visual effects (I watched in 3D in a theater) are stunning. However, Cameron was too in love with his technical gimmicks and over-extended numerous scenes, especially at the beginning. The portrayal of the Titanic striking the iceberg and ultimate sinking are powerful. However, the storyline is generally overwrought romance, though the chemistry between Winslet and DiCaprio is excellent. But some of the couple's ""escape"" scenes are over-extended to show off Cameron's toys.It does help to see the film in a large theater.",7/10
Titanic sinks !,gerry159,31 October 2007,"I've read a few comments about this version of Titanic and most comments seem to be written by 20 or 30 somethings who probably don't know the first thing about the real sinking of the Titanic. One comment said that he was in his thirties and that he was taken away by the fictional story intertwined with ""actual"" facts. Not true. The Titanic did not break in two as seen in this fantasy and the director simply ignored the fact that the Californian was only 10 miles away from the Titanic. So the ""actual"" facts were skewered. Secondly, at that time in history no one in steerage would be allowed to mingle with first class passengers and the young girl's background would have never allowed her to go against her mother's wishes. What seemed to have made the movie a smashing success is that Cameron did what Margret Mitchell did in Gone With The Wind, he took a modern girl and thrust her into an earlier society, and the teens - especially young impressionable girls - were carried away by the simple minded story. It would seem that most girls want to be ******* in the back seat of a car by the town ""bad"" boy. Finally, unlike the 30 something man who thought that Cameron had succeeded in the second half of the sinking, I ""never"" once thought that these people were on the Titanic, just a large ship. I have to admit that I too have seen thousands of movies and the only time I was carried away by the sinking of Titanic was the 1959 version called A Night To Remember based on an ""actual"" account of the tragedy by an eye witness,Lord Walter Lord. But, alas, any of these viewers would call that film a documentary, a dry word indeed. Heck, even the Clifton Webb, Barbara Stanwyck version seemed closer to the sinking that this over blown version.

Jack and Rose actually cause the Titanic to hit the iceberg. Watch closely.,pvpunch,13 January 2019,"In retrospect, it's easy to be cynical and stuffy about James Cameron's 1997 Titanic. It surpassed previous champs Star Wars and E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial as the top moneymaking film of all time (itself eventually surpassed by Cameron's Avatar), a personal affront to countless moviegoers over a certain age. With its record-tying 14 nominations and record-tying 11 wins, it turned members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences into a bunch of teenage fangirls (it wasn't until six years later, with The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, that AMPAS members turned into a bunch of teenage fanboys). It allowed Cameron, a genius as a filmmaker but an SOB as a human being (his ego's at least twice the size of the big boat itself), to become the self-proclaimed ""king of the world."" And it led to a lengthy period when it seemed as if Celine Dion's ubiquitous ""My Heart Will Go On"" was the only song ever recorded in American music history.But now it's time to go back to Titanic, which has been re-released to theaters not only in celebration of its 15th anniversary but, more soberly, only a few days removed from the precise 100th anniversary (April 15, 1912) of the disaster that snuffed out 1,500 lives. Cameron spared no expense for this re-launch, spending millions to convert the film into 3-D. Admittedly, most pictures that weren't originally filmed in that process but were only converted later as an excuse to boost ticket prices have failed to provide much extra oomph to the 2-D imagery (e.g. Clash of the Titans, Alice in Wonderland), but if there's one thing to be said about Cameron, the man knows how to derive the most technological bang for his buck. Titanic in 3-D looks fantastic, employing the format in a way that makes viewers feel as if they're the ones rounding a corridor corner or fighting to stay afloat in that icy Atlantic water.Fifteen years later, the highs and the lows still remain; luckily, what's good about the movie continues to easily outweigh its flaws. The fictional storyline is hoary in the extreme, relying on a ""wrong side of the tracks"" romance: Shortly after boarding the ship as it prepares to embark on its maiden voyage, poverty-stricken artist Jack Dawson spots socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater and instantly falls for her. In these career-propelling roles, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are excellent, delivering warm, winsome performances that provide their romance with an epic grandeur it certainly wouldn't have attained in less capable hands. The trouble, for both the young lovers and the audience members, is the presence of Rose's fianc√© Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), a supercilious millionaire who would just as soon push the lower classes off the face of the earth as give them the time of day. As I watched Cal constantly berate the poor, expose his ignorance in wince-worthy dialogue (criticizing a painting by Picasso, he opines that the artist will never amount to anything), smack Rose around, and try to kill Jack by taking shots at him, I kept wondering why Cameron had elected to leave off a mustache that Zane could twirl at regular intervals - the character is even more cartoonish than actual cartoon character Snidely Whiplash.",10/10
A North Atlantic carp,Spleen,6 September 1999,"First of all, `Titanic' was, on the whole and all things considered, a good movie.  There have been much sillier Best Picture awards handed out over the years.  I'll go through the basic drill as quickly as possible ...  Yes, the Titanic was HUGE - Titanic, as they say - and astounding to watch; yes, the musical score was intolerable, synthesised, neo-Celtic syrup; yes, Kate Winslet was gorgeous and, at one point, naked; yes, the story was pleasant, but pretty thin for three hours.  Have I covered everything?  Probably not, but I want to move on to complain about the very end.  The final few minutes contain footage that is just so manifestly stupid, so completely unnecessary, so obviously witless, that even if it's not enough to ruin the movie, James Cameron ought never be allowed to hear the end of it.  The trouble is that I can't lodge my complaint without giving some stuff away. So I feel obliged to issue aWARNINGto those people, wherever they may be, who have not yet seen `Titanic' - which I hope they will ignore.  Go on.  Have a peek.  It can't REALLY hurt you to know what you're in for.  It's not me, but James Cameron, who wants to lull you into quiescence for three hours and then hit you over the head with a big stupid mackerel.  -That said, I'll issue aSECOND WARNINGbefore getting down to business.My complaint is in two parts:(1)  A good deal of interest was supplied as we watched the diamond change hands throughout the movie, wondering where it would end up when the ship finally sank.  Well, it ends up - this is your last chance to stop reading - in Rose's hands.  She keeps it.  In fact she has it on her person seventy-something years later when she heads out into the Atlantic to meet the salvagers.  Then she wanders out to the railing one night and tosses it into the ocean.  WHY toss it into the ocean?  If she doesn't need the money, then the poor sods who invested heavily in order to find the diamond probably do - why not give THEM the diamond?  And what RIGHT does she have to effectively destroy this historical heirloom, former property of Louis XIV?  Clearly Cameron thought that, having made such heavy weather of the diamond early on, he needed to do something with it at the end, and he thought that throwing it into the sea would be very fine and dramatic. Dramatic fiddlesticks.(2)  Rose finally dies at a ripe old age and goes to a kind of heavenly Titanic where she is re-united with her true love, Jack.  But hang on. She's been married for several DECADES to some other bloke, who presumably has SOME claim on her affections in the afterlife.  I bet there'll be an awkward moment on the HMS Celestial Titanic when HE shows up.  But over-glorifying her (no doubt genuine) love for Jack is the least of it. Why the sudden dive into the supernatural?  One minute, we're in the material universe with the rest of the human race; the next, we're up in the sky somewhere.  I'm surprised they didn't give us a shot of Cal Hockley stoking the boilers in Hell.  (I've heard some people run the defence that this is all just a dream.  This strikes me as a strained interpretation; and even if it's the right interpretation, it's a poor defence.  Dreams are dramatically irrelevant.  At least, this one is.)These two complaints aren't trivial: they're illustrative of a more general problem.  The wondrous spectacle of `Titanic' is more than twice undercut by Cameron's facile theatrics.  Still - big ship, adolescent love, Kate Winslet, lots of water, and all that.",7/10
(Mostly) Worthy of its acclaim!,SPZMaxinema,25 October 2021,"While a bit excessive and grandiose at times with some uneven sequencing (and I can see how some might think that about it), it is undeniably a very well-directed and executed film with fine acting and writing overall.

Big Sinking Boat,gazzo-2,3 October 1999,"Big Sinking Boat is a great movie.

What puts Titanic up there with the other great epics-Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind, etc. is that Cameron knew, KNEW that to get you hooked, he needed characters people cared about, Felt for, and wanted to see more of.
The movie has heart, excellant performances, the best of FX; it pulls you into its world and doesn't let go until it wants to. Wrap that up with the most haunting theme music this side of Field of dreams....is it any wonder it made so much $$$ in '97-98?

It Took Me 7 Years to Get Through Titanic! My Review!,quardbye,21 December 2004,"An Open Letter to 20th Century Fox, James Cameron, Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslet:Dear Production Company, Sirs and Neato Breast Package:I am writing you to notify you that I have finally finished watching Titanic after repeated attempts over the past 7 years to watch it. It took approximately 23-30 separate cracks at viewing it, right where I left off to complete this task. I know that this might seem an overly long time to view all 194 minutes but I assure you the task was accomplished as fast as I possibly could. If you wouldn't mind terribly I have a few comments that may or may not be helpful to anyone reading this:* I really loved the 15 minutes of present day Rose talking to the diving crew (Bill Paxton and Suzy Amis) that appeared throughout the movie. I found everyone in those segments to be amazingly brilliant actors, and the scenes heartwarming, poignant and emotionally beautiful. * If you stopped right there it would have been a great masterpiece. * The choice to ruin such a wonderful movie short with 189 minutes of purely agonizing, torturous hell no doubt had a significant upwards impact on the suicide / murder rate of 1997. * I think I speak for everyone on this - if you killed Leonardo de Caprio in the opening credits even that would have been too much face time. * In the Director's cut DVD, even if Kate Winslet's nudey scene replaced 185 minutes of the 189 minutes of agony, it wouldn't have been enough of an apology for the remaining pain inflicted upon the audience. * In the ending credits Kevin Owers was mistakenly listed as Steward #3. He was actually Steward #4. Mark Capri was Steward #3. Only an imbecile would have made such a silly gaffe as Kevin and Mark look quite different. * Not even five minutes into watching it, I've never rooted so hard for an iceberg in all my life. * Never did I understand why there is a 7 day waiting period to purchase a firearm until the 12th attempt at watching Titanic. * The movie might have been a lot better if Leonardo pushed Kate off the railing in the ""King of the World scene"" and the whole thing played out as a murder mystery with a British cast actor playing the inspector. * Leonardo de Caprio was in the movie. WHY?! If you hate us so much why don't you just make a Death Ray Laser and blow up the world. Make the pain go away you $%#@!er! * A mime could have done a better job with a halogen light, water-filled bath tub, rubber ducky and a toaster. And more people would have liked it even though it was done by a mime. * There was a distinct lack of blood sucking zombies in the movie. Except for Leonard de Caprio. Actually he didn't really suck, that would have required talent and effort... * For $200 million dollars you really skimped on the iceberg, Cameron. It should have been much bigger. A chihuahua could have been hit by that thing and come away without a limp. * Celine Dion would have been most affective as Frozen Bobbing Corpse #35 instead of letting her sing! * You forgot to put a camera in the car! You're useless you know that? * Leonardo de Craprio was in the movie. You *bleep!*ersHopefully you found some of this feedback worth reading.Sincerely, Vincent B.

A masterpiece in historical accuracy as well as screen writing,medic249a2,18 June 2007,"When I saw James Cameron's Titanic on its opening day in 1997, I remember overhearing a woman explaining to her 2 daughters, 'The Titanic was a real ship and real people died on it', so they would not become totally caught up in the love story of Jack & Rose. I had first read about the legendary Titanic when I was about 10 years old, but I had no idea just how horrible the real disaster has been until reading Walter Lord's 'A Night to Remember' and seeing the 1959 B & W movie based on that book. When Dr. Robert Ballard found the Titanic's resting place in 1985 the world's interest was re-opened in the story, and Cameron's massive undertaking to retell the story of that fatal night in April 1912 was a success on any scale.I was mostly interested in the historical aspects of the story, and was not disappointed. Cameron's research into the ship's design, the passenger list (especially 1st-class), the costumes, right down to the last detail on the 1st-class china, is minute. It was SO close to the historical accuracy as detailed by Walter Lord (and later by Robert Ballard) that one could have easily believed they were actually there.Cameron's use of a love story featuring people at opposite ends of the spectrum (Rose, the dignified 1st-class girl and Jack, the impoverished steerage passenger) makes for an interesting element in the story. Though the story focused largely on their own experiences I don't think it detracted from the movie's historical accuracy. We often see Rose & Cal Hockley interacting with such real-life passengers as J.J. Astor, Ben Guggenheim, Molly Brown & the Countess of Rothes. It also focused well on Jack's experiences in steerage which were probably similar to those of many steerage-class passengers, who often found themselves trapped below decks in a ship that was rapidly filling with water.Some of the more interesting historical elements were cut & later released on the deluxe DVD edition; one shows Capt. Smith calling for the boats to standby close to the ship and Q.M. Hitchens (in Molly Brown's boat) ignoring the order. Also missing was the well-known scene of Macy's Department Store owners Isidor & Ida Strauss, which showed Mrs. Strauss insisting on remaining with her husband right until the end. (They are seen while 'Nearer My God to Thee' is playing, in their cabin as water rushes in on the floor.) Another missing scene which was understandably cut showed little Cora Caldwell (Jack's dance partner in steerage) and her family trapped by a locked gate with water rising behind them.Jack's ultimate fate was that of most steerage passengers; he died of hypothermia well before the arrival of the only rescue ship. Rose only survived because she managed to improvise a life raft on a floating piece of the Grand Staircase. She could have become one more of the small number of 1st-class women & children who did not survive (the only others were Mrs. Strauss, Mrs. H.J. Allison and her little daughter, Lorraine).Depending on how one wants to see it, this movie is either a grand love story against a backdrop of imminent doom, or a historically accurate movie with a love story as the background. Either way, Jim Cameron's masterpiece will long stand as one of movie history's greatest achievements. It could have been a colossal flop, but because so much planning had gone into it to make it as historically accurate as well as creating a story people would want to follow, it has succeeded beyond even Cameron's expectations. Well done James!",10/10
Collide With Destiny,raulfaust,28 April 2012,"After all the hype some friends of mine did about this movie and considering I saw only the last scenes a couple times, I did everything I could to get this movie on cinema. Sadly it stayed in my city for only 2 weeks and I could see it only today-- I had to go to a city 2 hours away from mine to catch this. In the first scenes I could see some cheesy lines and overacting-- mainly from DiCrapio and Paxton. After the first hour, the cheesy lines became less aggressive and I could stop remembering all the time that it is just a movie. The story is so well done that you feel inside the ship. They made a 3 hours plot so interesting and entertaining that you feel the movie just ended too fast. The relationship between the main couple-- although repeating the same old formula from Romeo and Juliet-- seems so realistic that we get jealous and want to have the same feeling they have. Unfortunately, it's not that easy to find someone you truly like in real life. One remarkable quote is when Jack says ""Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me""; you see, Jack was suffering with cold and about to die, but he still thought that dying would be worth it after the strong love they had-- which is, in my opinion, one of the most emotional lines in cinema history. Special effects are also quite good, some scenes are IMPOSSIBLE to explain how they've been built-- 3D or not. The story is all completely sad and painful to imagine, and you'll probably be very sad after seeing the whole picture, but will make you cherish your life even more. People can say whatever they like about ""Titanic"", but this is still a BEAUTIFUL movie to enjoy and comment with your friends for the rest of your life. Do your best to catch this on screen!",8/10

"Better than average movie, could have been great.",Laner,7 December 1998,"Let's get the negative out of the way... DiCaprio and Winselt are akin to a Boston Terrier and a Golden Retriever.  They really needed a more masculine lead for the love story to be convincing (but then that would have cut into ticket sales for the 13-19 female demographic, right?)  Anyway, one other thing that bothered me was unevenness of the dialogue.  Winselt's dialogue seems to jump from Victorian to Gen X somewhere during the halfway point; the merging of 90's attitude with a pre-WWI setting bothered me in general (language, cursing, general attitude of some of the characters, etc.), not to mention the way Cameron manipulates the audience against Billy Zane's character, who really has done nothing wrong until he whips out a gun near the end (wouldn't *you* be mad if your fiance was carousing around with some strange guy days before your wedding?  Me too).  And what was the deal with ""old Rose"" throwing the diamond off the ship?  That made absolutely no sense to me.With all that said, the overriding message of the movie (which was summarized in Jack's speech at dinner) is a good one, the storytelling is well done for the most part, and the special effects are awesome (with the exception of one or two scenes)",6/10

Overrated as much as the ship itself,knightout,6 February 2000,"Is this the most overrated film ever?Drawn-out, boring, predictable, uncreative and above all, unconvincing. Ah, little Kate and Leo, how sweet - are we really meant to believe it's 1912?
The bits that flank the main story with the Old Woman are superfluous and mind-numbingly banal, and the only real amusement value is when the people slide down the boat as it snaps in half.Is this meant to be funny? tragic? romantic? original? historical? Because it isn't. Go watch Trading Places or Weekend at Bernies or Groundhog Day, or Derek Jarman's Blue, and learn what goes into making a real film.
Unfortunately the likes of Titanic will invariably appeal to the mainstream sentimentality of middle American/England/etc.And why, when they've got that big hot boiler room on the boat, didn't they just melt the little Iceberg? Why did they take so long to sink? That old woman is the same character as Kate Winslet? *groan*1/10 is overrating this bland, unconvincing Trout of a movie, frankly.",No Rating
The infamous rose and jack on the door,majszakconrad,21 March 2019,When people started complaining about jack dying and calling them names is ridiculous. Even when mythbusters did it they seem to try to be as accurate as possible but what they missed is by jack staying off it that is why kept rose as dry as possible when the busters did stuff to get position just right and even tied the life best on the door I can tell you that it would have been more then extremely difficult to do that in north Atlantic freezing water your ha d do not work well and if they had to take there time in life suits if jack kept forcing rose in the water to safe himself he would have killed her as well the busters did a test that if jack was able to get out of the water immediately he would have barely survived just barely! Meaning if he even made her fall in o e or two times she would not have survived let alone probably 7 or more times the busters fell in and the door would have been sitting a few inches I. The water at that temp it would have more then enough to kill her. So I believe the way it happe. Was well thought out and orchestrated. And last thing if he would have survived the movie would not have been as good. It's the story of after titanic that makes the movie stick with you if he survived it would have made it a good movie not an amazing top 5 movie of all time.,10/10
A classic epic drama!,Jax0524,11 May 2008,"This movie may be the cheesiest film on the planet but I loved it!!! I don't know if I can express in words how great this movie is. All I can really say is this is a film that you will want to share with your grandchildren. I will admit there was a corny line or two especially on Leo Dicaprio's character and in my opinion I honestly thought Kate Winslet out shined Dicaprio even though Dicaprio did have his share of great moments in the movie. I really loved Jack Dawson but I just felt that his character was almost too one dimensional. When I first saw the movie I thought it would be a load of crap... boy was I wrong I was so entranced into the love story that I totally forgot that this was TITANIC so when the iceberg showed up I found myself sort of praying against all logic that somehow titanic would miss the iceberg, I even remember leaning to one side of my seat thinking if I did this the ship would miss lol. and of course when tragedy struck and the ship was sinking I was really caring for Jack,Rose and all the other passengers and even then I kept thinking maybe it will stop sinking and these poor people wont have to die. Throughout the rest of the film I was in complete utter shock I don't even think I blinked. even when Jack died I was in disbelief and in my head I was screaming along with rose for jack to wake up. The only time I cried in the film was at the very end of the movie when you see the titanic morphing into a new and pristine state and you see all the passengers inside greeting rose as she comes in then Jack extends his hand to her and they share a passionate kiss and everyones clapping, I was uncontrollable and the tears just kept coming. I thought it was perfect to end the film on such a bittersweet note and that music playing in the background just made my heart flutter. This is a movie you must see before you die!",8/10
james cameron what have you done?,purple4frogs,25 December 2000,"I avoided seeing this film for all of three years, due to the ludicrous amount of hype that surrounded it. I can now honestly say it was not worth the wait.  In his time, James Cameron has directed some classic films, Terminator, Aliens and The Abyss instantly spring to mind for their claustrophobia and generally tense atmosphere.  Titanic forgoes all said atmosphere and tension, relying on treacle-like sentimentality, and the unnecessary over-emphasis on special effects eclipses any innovation that his vision once had.

Sit right back and tell you a tale about a terrible film...,LazarusL,14 August 1999,"Blech. This movie cheapens both Hollywood and the audience. In fact all it needed was the Backstreet Boys (or one of their equally talentless clones) to make it the perfect piece of pre-adolescent garbage.Qualities: 1. The sets and costumes 2. Kathy Bates, although she is wastedFlaws: 1. The single worst script ever written for a period film. The dialogue seems akward for the 1990s let alone the 1910s. 2. The para-acting. I say para-acting because in some places I am fairly sure that in some seens somebody just picked up a cardboard cut-out of Leo and shook it around. 3. Special effects. The boat was great, but was not simulated. Watch it again and you will see how poorly the blue screening is done. You can actually see that people's faces have been pasted onto dummies in spots. Almost as poorly done as that awful Micheal Keaton snow-man movie. 4. Story. How cliched can a movie get? Charming poor boy rescues rich disillusioned young rich lady betrothed to obnoxious rich man. Gee, how original. I also found it amusing that the Cpt. chose to remain on in the movie when last I heard he got into a lifeboat in real life. 5. That miserable old lady.

A shining gemstone among American films,MoviesAreLife93,30 December 2013,"This film is a masterpiece. Every aspect of its production weaves together in a beautiful tale of tragedy, peril, and romance. The tremendous amount of effort that James Cameron and the entire cast put into this production is the essential reason that Titanic should never be forgotten, and should always be considered one of the greatest movies of all time. This movie is a true work of art - and the acting, the production value, directing, visuals,and music score all contribute. I doubt very much that there will ever be a film that portrays the fate of Titanic with such elegance as this one. Although this film runs well over three hours, there is not one wasted scene. This deserved every Oscar it received, and I consider its rating of a 7.7/10 to be a borderline travesty; it should easily be in the top 250 if not an 8.5/10 or greater. I love this movie!",10/10

Does anyone realize that certain people didn't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off? No, you don't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked (did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid?).I did cry in during one scene, though. The scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship. It looked like pool water! I'm thinking this movie made all this money and they couldn't even make the water from the ocean look real? unbelievable...Ohhh the band played on while the ship sank.. Just ridiculous.

"Yes, the script is a bit soggy, yes, the two leads are eye candy, yes, this is still a stunning film. *****",Howlin Wolf,7 February 2001,"OK, so the script is weak. OK, so the two leads are acknowledged as being very good looking. Do these two points detract from the overall quality of the film? Not really.Being an aspiring screenwriter myself, I am usually the first to complain if the script is packed with corny lines. However, I class James Cameron as a maker of 'Event' movies, and for the purpose of big budget blockbusters all that really matters is that the script pushes all the right emotional buttons. This one does. Despite not being a consummate wordsmith, Jim knows how to manipulate an audience so that they're cryin' at the soppy parts and gaspin' at the thrilling bits. So, in that sense, any minor script faults don't really come into it.What people also forget is that both Leo & Kate are actually good performers. Before this, Kate cut her acting teeth in weighty period adaptations like ""Jude"", and Leo did a good job of bringing his interpretation of one of the Bard's classic characters to the big screen.This is, as I've said, an event movie, and they don't come much bigger in scale or scope.",9/10
Grandiose schmaltz skillfully presented,DennisLittrell,28 January 2000,"This is much better than word of mouth led me to believe. Of course the script is corny and full of simplistic sentiment and it panders shamelessly to mid-brow sensitivities, and there's no question that the main intent is to jerk mass tears (but we could have guessed that from the subject). Still the photography is wonderful, Kate Winslet is captivating, and the plot clever. This is an old time Hollywood movie made not only to seduce the audience, but the Academy as well. And it succeeds. Billy Zane is perfectly one-dimensional and completely familiar as the conceited and selfish, immoral heir to a Gilded Age fortune. Kate Winslet as his intended is a ravishing beauty with oomph and a mind of her own. Leonardo DiCaprio as the wily and clever sketch artist who seduces her while twice saving her life comes across curiously as part Huck Finn and part John Boy. His romantic bravado in the freezing water saying he was so lucky to have won the steamship ticket because it allowed him to meet her was enough to embarrass even the most hardened Harlequin novelist.Most of the action before the bow scene was almost painful because just about every line was written so that a ten-year-old could understand what he was supposed to feel about whom. Evil, decadent rich people. Good, clever, hard working poor people. (They even party better.) Clich√© followed clich√©.But the romantic bow scene was artfully staged, and after that Kate came to life. It was strange to see her in the early scenes. She seemed almost a bad actress, as though the mediocrity of the direction had reduced her. But her part was so big and she had so much to do that her natural talent overcame the early junior high school text and the later schmaltz.Since the audience knows the ending, Director James Cameron knew he had a fine opportunity for dramatic irony, but his touch was a bit heavy handed, e.g., as they're boarding, a guy says, ""We're the luckiest sons of bitches in the world."" And since the audience knows eighty-five years of history unknown to the Titanic passengers, we get these further heavy bits of irony: On Picasso: ""He won't amount to a thing. Trust me."" And ""Freud, who is he?Is he a passenger?""My sensitivities were most offended, however, when Cameron has the savage crew smugly celebrate their good fortune before the safe they have hauled up is actually opened. That was the tip off for everybody in the audience to wisely know there would be little of value in the safe. Duh. In real life those guys don't celebrate until the gold is in the hand. Cameron's style is to flatter the audience, make them think they're smart, the usual pandering of a mediocre talent. Cameron even tries his hand at some cheap symbolism, i.e., mommie tells Rose that she must marry this suffocating and insufferable man because they need the money as she vigorously tightens Rose's confining corset.All right. Why did the Academy vote this best picture? Simply because it was a popular lavish production squarely in the Hollywood tradition, employing a whole bunch of movie folk, and it was a financial success, just what the industry craves. I should add that everything technical in the film was excellent, and Cameron's dramatic direction was a lot better than his dialogue. Also, because of the exquisite detail, watching the big ship sink was a whole lot of fun.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

"The Film That Launched 1,000 2+ Hour Films",mswatsoninc,31 January 2007,"Remember when a film that ran over two hours was a shiny beacon among film that exemplified greatness? Extended length represented importance, and we all had to stand up and take notice to its magnitude.Now, add into the mix that we all knew what the ending was going to be. ""Titanic,"" a very LONG story that history spoiled the ending to, made fools out of all the naysayers. Millions upon millions have seen this film, and we all know the outcome...brilliant! Where does that brilliance come from? Is it the acting? Well, nobody I know didn't want Gloria Stuart to walk home without a Best Supporting Actress Oscar...after all, we got her all dolled up and made her stay out late--but, it didn't happen.And, why didn't it? Was it the writing? Well, what can you say about a film that, for the last hour, at least, consisted of dialogue no more monumental than...""Rose!"" ""Jack!"" ""Jack!"" ""Rose!"" No, gentle readers, it's the special effects that kept the crowd there. As much as I hate the fact that I hate this film as much as I do on an intellectual level, I cannot deny that, no matter how many times I've seen that ship sink, I'm always mesmerized each and every time it does. Jim Cameron has indeed gone out of his way to stupefy us with his ending...and I bought it hook, line, and sinker.Although it took us almost two hours of banal dialogue to get there, the ending is absolutely spectacular in its delivery.

I liked it but now I don't.,DJAkin,5 February 2002,"It's strange, I really liked this movie BEFORE Leonardo because famous.  Now that he's famous and hanging out at all the local hangouts in Hollywood and causing trouble, it's thwarted my opinion of his acting skills.  I will review this movie as if I saw it without knowing about Leo.  Ok, it was great.  I loved the scenes and the character portrayed by Billy Zane (who people say I look like) was perfectly evil.  I have seen lots of movies which involve love but this movie happened to really capture the intensity of love that exists between Kate Winslet and Leo.  I admit, the scene in the car was goofy.  But the scene in the dining room was splendid.  I hated the part where Leo screams that he's the king of the world.  Movies like this and Saving Private Ryan make us so much more interested in History.  I agree that this movie was good.  But heck, I just love history movies.  Three thumbs up!",6/10

This movie is easily a work of genius.,userscreenname,8 August 2004,"Without a doubt in my mind, Titanic is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen, if not the best. It is moving each and every time I watch it. It takes this true and tragic story of the Titanic, and adds an amazing love story to it. It is beyond a mere romantic movie, it sets a standard. Winning eleven Academy Awards it is most definitely a masterpiece, and shows the brilliance of the art of filmmaking.James Cameron, the director of the Terminator movies, really shows a soft and compassionate side in this movie. The direction and production of this movie is incredible, it is very craft fully done. The synchronicity and very smooth transition from scene to scene makes every moment of this movie worth while. This movie is over three hours long, but it is the most easily spent three hours. Not at a single moment did I consider this movie to be dragged on or any other such nonsense. The acting in this movie was off the charts, this is the movie that sent Leo's career sky rocketing, it really shows his talent as an actor. The on screen chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is superb, extremely believable. I honestly can not see anyone else filling the shoes of these two, anyone in the movie in fact. What really makes this movie is the story, it is taken from the true story of the Titanic, but there is a fictitious love story the movie is focused around. It adds a Romeo and Juliet scenario, where the rich and poor are separated and can not be together. It is a very romantic and captivating tale. Throughout much of the movie I would be sitting there with a grin on my face in owe of how much chemistry these two have, also the humor, which is not found much in the film, is very classy and elegantly handled.The most memorable factor of this movie is the soundtrack. At any moment in time if the music from the picture were to come on anyone can easily distinguish that it belongs to this movie. Though not heard until the titles, Celine Dion has sung such a beautiful song. The music from this movie really entrances you, and hold you.This movie is easily a work of genius.",10/10
Perfection,jasleen_kaur,1 September 2009,"I have probably seen this movie so many times now, but it is still emotional to watch. It was pure genius to entwine history's most well known ship-sinking with a raw love story. Despite knowing it isn't completely true, you cannot help but think that it could've been one of many catastrophic stories within a catastrophic disaster. I believe the mere plot line kept faults in acting skills, etc so implicit that it is very hard to pick out any sort of fault.

The most overrated movie of All time,M83731,3 March 1999,"Titanic is the most overrated movie of all time.  I know that it sweeped the Oscars for the year 1997, but that doesn't mean that it deserves to be recognized as it is now.  There are numerous reasons why the film was labled as the best picture.  First of all, it made 1 billion dollars world-wide, and that's the record for any films.  The reason?  Leonardo Dicaprio's in the movie and if you are a girl and doesn't like Leonardo DiCaprio, you are not normal.  I know several girls who saw Titanic about 20 times.  Also, the movie was in fact, entertaining, I must admit.  I enjoyed it.  The sound and the score by James Horner and the cinematography was excellent.  Also, the year was a weak year for films.  L. A Confidential or Good Will Hunting or As Good as It Gets were good, but not terrific, but they were better than Titanic.  Titanic was a blockbuster, but the screenplay sucked.  The screenplay sucked like hell.  The plot was simple, a poor, living-on-the-wild-side boy meets a rich girl who is controlled by her mother and falls in love.  It is the most simplest plot ever!  Even a five-year-old can think of that!  But the excellent direction of James Cameron actually overcame the screenplay and made it entertaining so James Cameron deserved an Oscar for best director.  But the fact of the matter is, even with all the technical excellence, the foundation and the backbone of all films except for action films, the screenplay SUCKED!  Remember the line, ""Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! ""?  Is that the best Cameron can think of?  Films such as L. A Confidential and Good Will Hunting or As Good as it Gets had better screenplays and better cast of actors then Titanic.  So in conclusion, I admit that Titanic was a good action & chick flick, but it did not deserved to be awarded as the best picture of 1997.",No Rating

"The fateful iceberg was struck on April 14th, 1912",PCC0921,16 March 2022,"At the time, Titanic (1997), was the most expensive movie ever made. It also, for a long time, was the highest grossing movie of all time. It also won 11 Oscars, including Best Picture. It's haunting theme by Celine Dion, still gets stuck in people's heads, once they hear it again. The film was a phenomenon, that took a world by storm. It revolutionized the concept, that details are important. It also showed how well the art of CGI effects, in its short existence, had grown to this point in film. CGI was still an infant and it was called upon to do a Titanic job, with great results. The film also, successfully, was a homage to those who had fallen, during that terrible night on April, 14th, 1912.James Cameron started the story of Titanic, by giving the audience something more they could relate to. Before diving into this 85 year old tragedy, he opens the film up in present day (circa 1995), showing something that was a popular news item, over the last 12 years. That would be the discovery of Titanic, found at the bottom of the north Atlantic in 1985. He brings in, hot actor of the past few years, Bill Paxton (Apollo 13 and Twister), to play a fictionalized shipwreck hunter, Brock Lovett, who has brought with him a survivor from the Titanic disaster, Rose DeWitt Bukater (Gloria Stuart), who is now, about 100 years old. Her character is also fictionalized for the story.By doing this scene of the sunken ship, it reminds the audience why we are here. It reminds us, that the loss of 1500 lives, is the sobering part of all of this Hollywood flare. Rose is the focal point, that brings these two timelines together, as the film now goes into flashback and successfully tells the story of the tragedy of R. M. S. Titanic in 1912. I don't want to forget the convincing performances by Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack and Kate Winslet as young Rose. The romantic sub-plot throughout the movie was a big deal, when the film came out and helped with the box office, by attracting a more general audience. The goal was to make it so it wasn't just a disaster movie. James Cameron assembles a groundbreaking film, that despite the romantic fluff, is still an epic, spectacle, that needs to be seen, if you haven't seen it already.8.1 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8/10

How we almost abandoned ship,Lil'Girl,18 January 2000,"Admittedly, this film did nothing for me. It isn't the best movie I've ever seen but it certainly isn't the worst either. (Although my husbane would beg to differ -- he wanted to leave after an hour of Jack and Rose prancing around the decks). I persevered feeling that I paid good money to see this epic and would see it through to the end. Unlike the assertions of previous comments, I did see the film early on in the piece and wasn't led by the hype. No matter how much they tried there wasn't much chemistry between Leonardo or Kate. (I'm still having some difficulty trying to imagine them as lovers) Needless to say, I didn't get goosebumps looking at Leo and Kate pashing or warm fuzzy feelings when they were finally separated forever.Still, I wasn't totally devoid of feeling. I was transfixed by the last hour or so of the film.

"""James Cameron's TITANIC""",Hollywood_Yoda,17 May 2010,"In this, James Cameron's first masterpiece, we see the Titanic like never before, romanticized, with a love story to boot! When released in 1997, Titanic was expected to be a financial flop for Paramount and Fox studios, who had put up a record amount of production money, only to wind up with the highest grossing film of all time. A record that was kept for twelve years, until Cameron's next film, 'Avatar' outsold Titanic's ticket sales in 2009. We find Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet and Billy Zane in a love triangle to trump all love triangles prior! The film, although partially based on actual events and made up people, was a hit with audiences in the summer of 1997, breaking box office records from start to finish.

Finally saw it... in 3D and 25 years late,ethan-e-mathias,18 February 2023,"After years of digging in my heels and not seeing this film purely because everyone told me ""I had to see it"", I finally relented and took my wife (who is a Titanic super fan) to see it for Valentines Day. A couple observations from someone who's spent 25 years aware of its existence but purposefully avoided it:The hype is well-deserved; it is an excellent film. To be clear, I never disparaged it or thought that it wouldn't be. I am just stubborn, and now I am glad that I've seen it. Although there are definitely films I enjoy more, ""masterpiece"" is an apt term given its epic story and the grandeur in the storytelling.It was fun to see cultural references (e.g. Famous lines, the hand on the steamy car window, the old people cuddling in bed, etc.) in their original context.The movie seems to have aged...uniquely. I say ""seems to"" because I'm viewing it from a 2023 moviegoers POV, so I can't know for sure. I am skeptical that someone making the movie today would film the scenes with domestic violence (both the actual acts of, and reactions to) in the same way it appears. Same with some of the portrayals of various cultural groups. One thing was very clear: this was a movie about a ""tragic disaster"" that was made prior to Columbine and prior to 9/11. Perhaps it is just me, but I found some of the crowd scenes to be unnervingly vivid in their depiction of human terror and chaos. This is not to say there aren't modern movies with vivid depictions of horrific loss, but somehow the romanticism and opulence of the movie doesn't quite offset the mass panic and loss of life. This is not a criticism but an observation; it's a testament to Cameron's direction and the actors involved.It was a little too long. An epic story deserves quite a bit of leeway in terms of runtime, but Cameron's devotion to the framing device could've been truncated and it would still be serviceable. Same with the ending.The element of classism seemed sadly prescient, both as it appeared in the world of the story but also in its portrayal on film. Major Snowpiercer vibes at times.Kathy Bates is a damn treasure.Those are my thoughts. I definitely don't think I lived a less full existence having waited 25 years to see it, but I'm glad I finally saw it. And I will now be spared the pearl-clutching gasps of ""You've NEVER seen Titanic?!?"" when people talk about iconic films.",8/10
One of the all time greatest movie.,cpmawar,16 November 2018,Wow!! What a masterpiece of James Cameron. All time Greatest movie after The Shawshank Redemption. Hat's off to mr. Cameron. This masterpiece never gets old.,10/10
Quite simply: Awesome,konover,31 May 2003,"As the movie prepared to open to audiences, I only had one objective. I wanted to see how James Cameron recreated the disastrous sinking like never before. There had been Titanic movies before, which were very good, but this was the first time technology would make the sinking look real and as accurate as possible. Cameron had tons of research and actual scientific knowledge available to him to tell the story and how it happened. We know now, for example, that the Titanic broke in two---a fact that was not yet known in the 1950s when two Titanic movies were released. My feeling on Cameron's movie was: I just want to see how he recreated the disaster.
What I found was a pleasant surprise. More than a special effects success, I was drawn in by the fictitious story of Jack and Rose. Iconoclast viewers brushed off the romantic story like a flake on a blue suit, but it struck me differently. I thought about the totality of the 1500 lives that Jack and Rose represented. I thought about how many couples that really loved each other, like Jack and Rose did, that perished in freezing waters. I thought about the terror that must have possessed so many as they waited to die in the freezing darkness.The movie was powerfully realized. And although there were no Oliviers or Brandos in the cast, the acting was realistic and solid enough to invoke empathy for all of the characters. It may not be the ""guy"" thing to say, but I have to admit to choking a bit when Titanic angled, ready to sink to its destiny, and watching the hundreds of passengers desperately cling to their last moments as best as possible. Never have I seen a movie create despair so tangibly. I've always been a Titanic buff. I don't know why, but I know that, for me, Titanic's story always held a certain mystique and sense of awe . And this was years and years before Cameron's movie hit the big time. For me, the movie remains a moving, triumphant experience. I can't help but feel Cameron captured my perception of the Titanic mystique and put it on film for all to see. Let the magic sweep you away to a time and ship long gone...",No Rating

Are we really suppose to believe that Nazi Aryan race poster boy Leonardo is a poor working class guy with his neat clothes and very clean blonde hair? The sinking is quite amazing but two and a half hours of dreary love story is simply mind-numbing. James Cameron is nothing but an inflated ego and hasn't directed anything since cos he realises we all know this film is rubbish and hes talentless. Now that the hype is long gone, we all realise how horrifically bad this overblown cliched Hollywood weak excuse for a movie really is. If you want to see the real best picture of 1997, see ""L.A.

James Cameron's worst film,mentalcritic,30 June 2002,"I've seen a lot of overblown films in my lifetime, and I know that a lot of people believe the credibility of the Oscars died when Tom Hanks won two Best Actor awards in sequential years, but this film is what really killed the Oscars. The idea that Ben Hur could set a record for winning the most is hilarious when the story is taken into account, but the idea that such a contrived load of nonsense like this could equal it while a really well-made film like Gladiator only gets four awards... well, you get the picture.I won't bore you with a detailed speech about the plot, because I am sure that anyone reading this will have been subjected to exactly that enough times already. Instead, I will just go through some of the things that really stood out in this film.One thing that always bugs me about this film is how James Cameron claims to pay attention to the most minute detail in his films, and yet the pistol used by Billy Zane has pretty much been positively confirmed by numerous gun collectors as not having been put into production at the time the film was made. It would have been more factually accurate to put a gun from the old Spaghetti Westerns in this film, as a matter of fact. Another thing that flies right in the face of the facts is that a rich power-mad family such as that which our heroine is from would basically beat it into their daughters from birth that they had to take any crap a suitor would dish out at them. It might have been politically incorrect to put this on the screen, but that's the way the society such websites as ChristianAnswers.net wants us to return to actually functioned.Another aspect of the film that bothers me is Leonard DiCraprio. When we first hear his dialogue about his world travels, well, I was laughing, because he hardly looks old enough to go to the coffee shop unsupervised. Kate looked like she outweighed him by a good fifty pounds, at least, and I'm sure the other passengers who were slumming it in steerage would have introduced him to the concept of how prisoners love each other. There's nothing quite like a guy who looks like a girl after being locked in a dank, smelly hole with your average underclass member of a repressive society for a few months. Naturally, the film goes out of its way to make you hate the rest of the passengers, so the proposed idea of having Arnold Schwarzenegger blow up the iceberg and save the day wouldn't have saved the film anyway. Unfortunately, I also found Kate's character rather unconvincing a lot of the time, too. Her behaviour just doesn't quite sync up with what you'd expect out of a girl from a circa-191X family of inbreeders.In short, this film was nothing more than James Cameron's cynical pulling of the strings attached to the heart of every 12-50 year old woman who really ought to know better. Once the cinema-screen impact of the sinking is gone, there is nothing to endear the film to anyone who either has a brain in their head or likes to be made seasick. Instead, what we have is yet another marketing exercise from the mainstream media that pretty much proves ninety percent of people in the world can be told what they want instead of given it. Cameron just hasn't done a good film since Aliens because his ego is way out of control. And boy, does Titanic prove that in a big way.",No Rating

A waste of the money it cost,Sam-134,8 January 1999,"There is an unfortunate belief in Hollywood that special effects makes a movie good or bad. I prefer to think that what matters is the human aspect of it: the writing, directing, acting. So it is unfortunate that many try to defend Titanic based on the special effects quality.There were many great movies made in 1997, including but not limited to Good Will Hunting, As Good As It Gets, Kundun, Dark City and Gattaca. And one interesting thing about these movies is that each of them, with the possible exception of the latter two, could be made at not twentieth the tithe of the production cost of Titanic. With that money, many great movies could be made.When a movie has a high special-effects budget, it is the job of the effects not to support the poor quality of the film, but to serve a spartan purpose of whatever it is they are used for. If Cameron were to try to show one tenth the sincerity shown in a good movie, instead of showing off special effects, Titanic would have been far better than the disappointment that it was.",No Rating
Why I like this movie so much,das_r,27 December 2007,"I've seen this movie plenty of times about the time it was released. Well, a few years later, about 1999, but it's not so important. The point is, I was about 10 or 11 years at this time. But now, in the German Christmas TV programme, I saw this movie again. Only partly, but I was amazed of it. I became aware of things I didn't became aware of in this young age. As there were: 01) It might sound a bit bathetic, but ""Titanic"" is a really romantic film, it's kind of a Love Manifesto. There are two people who really love each other, with all consequences. This is really great, to see this true and honest love between two people which you don't see too often in real life, even though this is just a movie.02) When you look a bit behind this romantic facade, ""Titanic"" is also a deeply social critical movie. On the one side, it shows those affectedly luxury and all those needless problems of the Rich, as well as the belief that with enough money you can buy anything (""We had an arrangement, Mr Murdoch!""). On the other side you see the misery of the Third Class people, you see how they are trapped in the sinking ship like animals, and you see how the Rich are treated much better only because they have money. But on the other hand, there is Rose, who only cares about Jack Dawson's personality and not about his financial situation.03) The last thing I love at this movie is quite simple: It is a great document of one of the sadest stories in younger human history. It shows it all in detail, the arrogance of the White Star Line people, the desperation of the passengers as the ship is sinking, the fight for their life, the desperate try to find other ships to help, all showed really realistic and also strictly written after the reports of survivors. I think those whole Titanic thing is very interesting, and so I like the movie for showing the happenings of this evening very realistic and fascinating.",10/10
"Tragic tale, triumphant film",hall895,17 July 2014,"Titanic is now a film which people go out of their way to dismiss. Being contemptuous towards the film is the fashionable thing to do. Admitting you like the film marks you as being desperately uncool. Yes, the Titanic-mania of 1997-98 was a bit much. The box office records, the 11 Oscars...at some point people said enough was enough. But this is a film not so easily dismissed. Perhaps it was not worthy of the unprecedented frenzy which surrounded it. But it certainly does not deserve the derision it has received. It is a very solid film. A compelling story, beautiful visuals, stellar performances...this film has much to recommend it. James Cameron risked a lot to bring his vision of Titanic to the screen. The risks paid off. Titanic is great entertainment, truly captivating, at times legitimately thrilling. It's not a perfect movie, maybe it falls a touch short of true greatness but only by the thinnest of margins. All the hype, and all the eventual backlash, can't obscure the fact that this is indeed a very good movie.Of course this film is ultimately destined to turn tragic. But the film is not so much about the sinking of a ship. It is a love story. A very unique, heartwarming love story. A story about a young woman who found the love of her life. And found herself. All in the span of a few days aboard the ill-fated Titanic. Part of the film's charm is that this woman, Rose, tells us her story herself. 101 years old when we meet her Rose takes us back to the Titanic. And with her words she brings the great ship, and its passengers, back to life. One of those passengers is Cal, an arrogant man to whom, much to her chagrin, Rose is engaged. Her family needs Cal's money. Rose does not love him but family, and society, dictate she must marry this rather reprehensible man. But then things take a turn. Rose, in unusual and potentially embarrassing circumstances, meets Jack Dawson. While Rose enjoys first-class splendor Jack is a man from another world. A third-class passenger, no money to his name, no standing in society. Jack has no place in Rose's world. But, rather inevitably, Rose decides she wants a place in Jack's world. Yes, it is one of those scarcely believable stories in which a woman falls madly in love with a man she just met. But in her heart Rose knows. Jack is the one. She must follow her heart. She will throw away her privileged life to be with the man she loves. Unfortunately Cal is not going to give her up easily. But before this conflict can play itself out an iceberg intervenes.The love story of Rose and Jack is easy to embrace, especially when you contrast Jack, so good-hearted, with the vile Cal. Leonardo DiCaprio performs the role of Jack very well, making you believe there is so much more to this guy than is readily apparent. Jack is no ordinary third-class nobody and DiCaprio captures this unique individual wonderfully. But for as good as DiCaprio is it is Kate Winslet who is the real star here. Rose goes on an incredible journey of personal growth and Winslet nails it every step of the way. Rose is radiant, smart, witty and ultimately heroic. Winslet brings all those characteristics to the screen perfectly. Rose finds she is stronger, in so many ways, than she ever imagined. It takes a great actress to evolve along with such a character. And Winslet is clearly a great actress. For as good as DiCaprio and Winslet are in the two key roles the performance of Billy Zane as Cal, the main antagonist, leaves much to be desired. Zane takes Cal's villainy to cartoonish levels, by the end it's impossible to take the character seriously. Spitting his lines rather than speaking them Zane seems absolutely desperate for attention. Unfortunately the attention he brings upon himself is that of sticking out like a sore thumb in an otherwise stellar cast. Cal had to be evil to make the film's story work. But Zane overplays it so badly you half expect to find out that it was Cal who steered the ship into the iceberg and that he did it on purpose.Zane aside the rest of the supporting cast is excellent. While the lead characters are fictional there are many true-life figures aboard the ship. Some, such as ship builder Thomas Andrews, come across very well. Others, such as White Star Line managing director J. Bruce Ismay, do not. Whether those they portray are ultimately heroic, or quite the opposite, the cast by and large do an excellent job bringing these historical figures to life. And Cameron, with a great visual sense, beautiful sets, and state of the art effects, brings the ship to life. Titanic sails again. For the film to really work you had to believe you were really aboard a ship steaming across the Atlantic. Cameron makes it happen. We're right on board, right there with the passengers as they embrace the ship's majesty. And right there with them as the ship sinks to the bottom of the ocean. It is the love story which is at the heart of the film's success. But the sinking of the ship is spectacular, both haunting and thrilling. Perhaps the most fun sequence in the film comes when Rose wanders down to third-class where a raucous party is in full swing. We know that nearly all of those passengers are doomed. But Rose ensures they will not be forgotten. In telling us her story she tells us theirs as well. Through her Cameron has given a voice to all who were lost on that tragic night. Titanic is a film not without its flaws. But it is a film journey well worth taking. Three hours fly by as we follow the first, and last, journey of the great ship.",7/10
Exceptional music and movie,Movie Hound Video,28 January 2007,"As a married man in his early 40's, I must say I have seen this movie at least 6 times before today. I had the chance to enjoy this movie with my wife and two teen boys (their first time). I am so glad they could appreciate the romance of the movie as well as deal with the length of the movie. Both of my boys have loved the music since it was released, but never watched the film because of the chic flick image. It made me proud that they could appreciate such a film. I agree that Kate Winslet deserved an Oscar for her performance which seems the majority of opinion. James Horner's music is considered one of the greatest soundtrack's of all time and rightfully so. I just saw the deleted/extended scenes from the 2005 DVD and they were great. The commentary is dry at times, but I recommend that you give it a chance if you can.",10/10
"Not exactly worthy of all the hype upon its release in 1997, but passable",Beta_Gallinger,16 February 2009,"As I'm sure you know, this was a HUGE hit back when it was in theatres, turning out to be the highest grossing movie of all time, but as hard as it may be to believe, I've finally seen it for the first time, over eleven years later! I was eleven years old while the film was enjoying its box office success, and yes, I did hear a lot about the movie and how massive it was. I was also soon familiar with the famous song, ""My Heart Will Go On"", performed by the greatly despised Celine Dion. Still, I never actually saw the movie for over a decade. Shortly before finally watching it, I knew that despite its popularity, it has also been widely ridiculed. So, it wouldn't have surprised me if I wasn't very impressed at all, but that didn't exactly turn out to be the case.84 years after the sinking of the Titanic, a group of treasure hunters discover a drawing of a naked woman from the ship's wreckage. A TV report catches the attention of a woman around 101 years old named Rose Calvert, who contacts the treasure hunters to tell them that she is the one in that picture! She then goes with her granddaughter, Elizabeth, to visit the team. Although they are skeptical, the very elderly woman begins to tell them about her experience back in 1912, when she was Rose DeWitt Bukater, a rich teenager aboard the Titanic, believed to have gone down with the ship! She tells them how she began an unlikely romantic relationship with a poor young man on board named Jack Dawson after he saved her from a suicide attempt, and how this led to conflict between Rose and her family and oafish fianc√©e Caledon Hockley.Several months ago, I watched ""Pearl Harbour"", and it seemed that some people compared that film to ""Titanic"", which I thought was not good. As a result, I was expecting the same kind of poor dialogue and romance in this movie, the first of the two. Well, I definitely did find some fairly weak dialogue, and there definitely are flaws in the romance, so the film does have those things in common with its successor, but fortunately to a lesser degree. At least none of it made me laugh here, though it certainly does take some points off. Some of the performances here are also weak, including some of the actors who played the treasure hunters in the 90's parts of the film. When the acting isn't poor, it's basically average, for the most part at least. Oh well, at least I actually cared about what happened to the two main characters, even if they weren't portrayed as well as they could have been. I watched this movie on VHS, and due to its length, it was split onto two tapes. To tell you the truth, I was definitely more impressed with the content on the second tape than the content on the first. Without the climax (which I saw on the second video tape), I would be giving this movie a rating no higher than 6/10, but even that part isn't perfect.I know this is a widely loathed movie. I'm also no fan of the widely loathed Celine Dion, who performed the hit song for the film, and am not proud of the fact that she's from my country. (Mind you, I think ""My Heart Will Go On"" is the only song in her catalogue I've ever heard more than once, and I couldn't even name any of the others.) However, while it is severely flawed, and I wouldn't want to watch it multiple times, I think it could have been much worse. The climax is suspenseful, and before that, the film basically has some good and not so good moments. There may be some FAIRLY moving moments in this 1997 blockbuster, though nothing that even came close to having me in tears, unlike apparently many other viewers. It was also interesting for me seeing Gloria Stuart as 101-year-old Rose, since I had previously seen her in ""The Invisible Man"", which was made over sixty years before this film! Is this version of ""Titanic"" thoroughly inaccurate? I'm sure it is, so don't watch it if you want a realistic film based on historical fact. It's a fictional story about a romantic relationship between two fictional people. While it isn't worthy of its position as the highest grossing movie of all time, nor was it worthy of eleven Oscars, at least I think I can call it half-decent. I'm not sure what it would have been like watching this film without having seen ""Pearl Harbour"" first, but now that I've seen them both, I do think ""Titanic"" is pretty good in comparison.",7/10
Are we all stupid? James Cameron thinks so.,Cryofire,27 January 1999,"I personally think this movie is a crime to humanity, and a disgrace to the movie scene.  I am heavily disappointed in James Cameron here, just by making this movie.My first problem with this movie is the setting.  He turned one of the greatest mechanical travesties of mankind's history into a love story.  Only on a few accounts did he (James Cameron) show any real pity for those who were on the Titanic.  By giving the characters a snobby attitude, Cameron assumes we're not supposed to feel bad when we see them falling from the deck of a ship and breaking their backs on railings?  The few decent parts of this movie were the examples of ill-treatment to the lower classmen/women.As for the love-story....ever hear of ""Lady and the Tramp""?  This is a blatant rip-off of a classic Disney film. Granted, the character of Jack is charismatic, and holds an intelligence all in his own....but LEONARDO DiCAPRIO!?  He did a decent job in Romeo and Juliet, but this was just bad acting.  Kate Winslet also did a sub-par job....I didn't find her emotion to be real.  Billy Zane did a decent job as a villain, but I think he just ""looked"" the part. Overall the acting was sub-par in this movie.  Next time we have a monumental motion picture event like Titanic, I would like to see actors/actresses who have NOT made appearances in seventeen magazine.The whole idea of the tragedy of the Titanic on film makes me sick.  I cannot believe a human being would make money off this film, and be able to live with himself.  Mr Cameron, you disappoint me.This movie should not have been made into a love-story, let alone be made at all.  5/10 stars.",No Rating
Titanic,kayozz2001,8 November 2009,"Without spoiling too much it's about this old woman who has a dream about this ship that is going to sink.She has to stop it before it's too late and has this piece of jewellery that will somehow prevent it from hitting an iceberg and sinking.Unfortunately the ship is full of guests and they're having a party on it, so in order to get on board she has to pretend she is a young scallywag (played by none other than Leonardo DI Caprio) and infiltrate the ship.Unfortunately she gets tangled up in a bitter sweet lesbian affair with a woman who shares her name (all the while pretending he's a man AND trying to stop the ship from sinking!)and fails to notice the giant iceberg which hits the ship. The party is ruined and there's not enough boats.I'm not going to spoil the end, but i'll leave you with a question...Will the titanic sink?

Really an accident?,gkeith_1,3 October 2007,"I write in bytes. Saves time. This movie a gem. A rather fictional love story of poor boy comes on to rich girl from social climbing family who are down on their luck. Evil villain of a fianc√© for the girl. The poor boy is a talented artist who has spent time sketching naked harlots in Gay Paree, lol. Rich girl strips her clothes off and poses for boy artist. Nasty fianc√© goes gunning for poor boy. Puppy dog valet/hit-man for fianc√© does some really goofy chasing down the ship for poor artist boy.As an OSU history major, I feel, in all seriousness:I know this story was fictional, and that the real story was tragic and ugly. Sometimes I think the supposed disaster was a real set-up and early harbinger of World War I. Perhaps the ship designers and certain cruise line executives were in cahoots with the evil perpetrators of the war. The war started in Europe in 1914, two years after the Titanic disaster. Not just a coincidence. German leaders had been arguing among themselves for decades leading up to the war, and perhaps they figured that a disaster really embarrassing the British and Americans would be a real coup in their attempt to conquer the world.Maybe the Germans were investors in White Star, and wanted the insurance money to fund their growing war. Wars do cost lots of money, and Germany as a united nation began in 1871, only about 40 years earlier. Young nations don't have a lot of money to fund such endeavors.There are no accidents, according to philosophical theory. Germany had been in unrest all during the early part of the 20th Century -- events leading up to World War I. Another close-in-time famous ship disaster was 1915: the Lusitania, hit-destroyed-sunk by German U-boats (armed with torpedoes) who had warned that ship not to be caught in its shipping lanes. Lots of famous and important people were aboard the Lusitania, and also lots of rich-and-famous were aboard the Titanic. Even the ships' names are rather alike.The chilling part is that it is now almost 2012 -- 100 years after the fatal Titanic disaster. Now, in 2007, 2012 is five years away. All things come back around, and I imagine there will be some sort of commemorative remembrances regarding the Titanic in 2012. Why has this 'accident' been called the most famous ship disaster in history? Why are all those movies (and even a Broadway musical) made of this unfortunate loss of life and wealthy property?Titanic: How could such a magnificent ship suddenly crack up like so much balsa wood? I feel there was lots of sabotage and manipulation. I hope that there were real first-love stories aboard this ship, as suggested in this movie.The Queen of the Sea was supposed to be bigger, stronger, better, and much more well-built than all other ships of its day, not to mention ultra-luxurious and mega-speedy. Its riveting was world-class, and its workmanship unparalleled. Nay, not an accident, but perhaps, and only perhaps, a ""red herring"" to take the world's attention away from the growing Teutonic holocaust in Europe.",10/10
Something's Missing,whynotwriteme,10 March 2000,"Perhaps unique among time-travel science fiction in that there is no explanation given for these 1990s characters finding their way to 1912.  The story begins with them in the past, but there is never any mention of a time machine or other device bringing them back.  Obviously, they are not natives of the early 1900s, given their behaviour and speech, and I find it quite strange that James Cameron chose not to show us how they travelled back in time to 1912.  He handled the time traveller angle much better in the Terminator films.   Special effects are great, except when obviously CGI, which is often.",No Rating
"An antic, frantic ""Titanic""...",Mister-6,30 April 2000,"No doubt that James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is an epic story, told in grand fashion.  But let's get one thing straight right now.This is NOT a human interest piece.  This is a special effects piece.Look at all the Academy Awards it has won.  The majority of them in the technical arena, most logically.  If perhaps not the strongest in character motivation, Cameron is first and foremost a craftsman.  It's what he works best at (just look at the ""terminator"" films).  Every detail is lovingly placed and arranged with a perfectionist's eye and hand.  And the final half of the film (which I'll get to) is a masterpiece in itself.But as far as characterization goes, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio play their parts like good soldiers but are simply too shallow and unconvincing as the puppy-lovers caught up in the huge sweep of tragedy (a plot device as old as motion pictures themselves) to project much emotion or personality. Instead, they just walk around and say their lines as the rest of the movie goes on its merry way.Which is as it should be, I guess, as the movie does indeed have its own agenda and does its work very well, thank you.The final half of the movie is what everyone is interested in, anyway.  And Cameron and company acquit themselves very well as the Titanic slowly splits and sinks into the icy deep waters below.  Every single moment has its drama as the different passengers confront their mortality while the ship confronts its own.  Older couples comforting each other, parents holding their children tightly as the water rises around them, musicians valiantly playing hymns for the passengers, the doomed ship's designer calmly waiting by the fireplace as his creation collapses around him.  In this respect, ""Titanic"" deserves every award and accolade it has received, even more so.  No one modern director has worked so hard and emphatically on a vision as Cameron has here.  But as far as the human effort, he is the modern-day Hitchcock: herding his cast cattle-like from scene to scene, positioning them just so to emphasize the FX.But just consider the FX, and you'll understand.In view of the sight of the Titanic itself, that earns ten easy stars.  But subtract four stars for failing to find one cast member or character as interesting as the ship itself (no, not even Gloria Stuart.  Sorry, Gloria).In all, six stars for ""Titanic"".  Fast forward to when the iceberg makes its appearance and you may enjoy it even more.",6/10
Cutting about 1/2 of the contrived romance would've made a great movie,Zack-23,9 April 1999,"OK, so there HAS to be a romantic story intertwined to make a real blockbuster.  I like romance, but too much is too much.  If  half the time spent on the romantic fling had gone into historical or technological accuracy or even developing some of the stories of the lives of the hundreds of others aboard, I would no doubt rave that this was the best movie of the year.  But they didn't... and I won't.  It was a good movie that could have been a great movie.  'A Night To Remember' is far better for my vote.",No Rating

"""Of course, the experience of it was somewhat different.""",The_Movie_Cat,26 December 2000,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
This is one of the most realistic films I've ever seen, a modern day classic that allows for drama by having the lead character tell the tale in flashback, letting you know she lives till the end. This framing sequence neatly comes back three times, and we get a voiceover, cannily breaking up the narrative.It turns out the elderly lady was Kate Winslet, a rich society girl engaged to the boo-hiss pantomime villain played by Billy Zane. Well, he is English, after all. Anyway, this upper class madam soon falls for a cocky brat with a head shaped like a turnip, and starts performing activities generic of her class. Like spitting over the side of the ship and getting her boobs out. I did give the movie 8/10, but that was for Kate's mighty chest, rather than the film itself. Mind you, it's all quite understandable as Jack has an enticing line in fortune-cookie platitudes, spouting lines like: ""When you got nuthin', you got nuthin' to lose"" and ""Make each day count.""Where it really succeeds is in its accessibility, like many Cameron movies. Rather than confusing the issue with all that characterisation nonsense, we have dialogue that is functional and neat stereotypes like the Irish crew that love to do nothing more than dance a merry jig. Whuy, it be straight out o' a advert four de Morphees. And just like it, they're not bitter. Well, they're the US's spiritual kinfolk, aren't they? Even the Scots and Welsh help a little bit, but the English can't wait to shoot the passengers. And only the Americans are truly heroic.Perhaps the stumbling block is the superb realisation of the ship itself. To correct this error, Cameron gives us some ropy CGI, from the background where Rose attempts suicide, to the iceberg, which is as two dimensional as Billy Zane's character. Apparently the cheap effects came about because, despite costing $200 million to make, over half went on Zane's mascara. Ooo, he's a real villain, he is! Another wrong foot is casting the RSC Jonathan Hyde. The thought of having a decent actor in the film is absolutely abhorrent, yet luckily it's not a mistake the director makes twice.But the masterstroke is the running time. Where a 90 or 120 minutes duration might feel just about right, Cameron drags it out to over three hours. Genius. Other great moments include the constant references to the ship not being able to sink, and the cod English accents. Any old director worth his salt could cast realistic accents, but giving it a touch of the Van Dykes is a feat of remarkable post-modernism. In fact, the only thing the film needed to take it to the very peak of perfection was a dreary love ballad at the end by Celine Dion. Oh dear.",6/10
Impressive enough to make up for flaws,Progressive-Element,25 May 2013,"James Cameron takes budget-busting to a new level for his bold, ambitious attempt to create a film set around the titular ship's doomed voyage.It becomes clear after awhile there's only one 'character' the director is really interested in - the Titanic. And what an impressive job he's done at recreating the sights of what was then the world's largest ship. Truly a loving ode to the tragic White Star liner.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are just likable enough as lovers from different social states, that one can almost stomach the schmaltzy slushy moments of the film, not to mention some pretty weak dialogue. Certainly Kate makes us guys like her a lot more when she doffs her clothes...The rest of the cast are good enough but tend to boil down into one-dimensional stereotypes, including the ones playing real people. Billy Zane on the other hand, while perfectly hissable, is only missing a moustache he could twirl. 'Mwahahaha, you are marrying me pretty, mwahahaha.' When the ship finally hits the damn iceberg after about 90 minutes have passed, we get to the best part of the film. The sinking provides moments as tense as the Terminator stalking Sarah and Kyle in the computer factory, and Ripley making her way through an alien nest in her search for Newt. It is in this segment we see the relentlessness James Cameron often puts into action set-pieces. At first, there's slow-build tension with the ship slowly taking on water, before it drives the film into full-blown panic. The later scene of floating frozen bodies perhaps does more to convey the true horror of the sinking than the actual effects work.All of this is told in flashback by a much older Rose to a treasure-hunter and his team searching for a diamond. These are actually the weakest moments in the film, and often detract from the tone of the 1912 scenes. Gloria Stuart's narration pushes the film further into schmaltz overload, but that's nothing compared to an ending, recently voted as the corniest scene ever put on film.One factor that helps absorb you into the viewing experience, and just stops you from vomiting, is James Horner's sweeping score. Fortunately, we don't hear Celine Dion until the end credits.For all it's flaws, it still works on the level of a grand old-fashioned epic.",8/10
Greatness,Vic_max,14 August 2006,"This was a great movie. It's hard to see how I could improve on it. It was over budget - ambitious - and amazing.I'll start with the period scenery of the early 1900s - very nicely done. The range of dress styles and accommodations aboard the ship as they relate to class was impressive. The recreation of the Titanic was also well done. Throughout the movie the viewer gets to journey throughout this large ship and see everything from the huge engine room through first the class dining area.Also nicely done was the music (songs and music vocalizations). They integrated very nicely with the story and the idea of an ocean liner.The story - though fictional - was entertaining. Instead of creating a simple story at the time of the Titanic, Cameron gave us two - one now and one then - and linked the two nicely. There is plenty of action, romance and fun.Of course, everything in the story happens against the backdrop of one of the most famous disaster events in history. Cameron took his time depicting the tragic event and gave us a seemingly realistic insight into how events unfolded during the sinking event. The special effects were excellent.If you're in the mood for a great story and have an interest in the Titanic, definitely consider watching this movie.",9/10
Without a Doubt an Epic Masterpiece! Absolutely Astonishing!,tstrycula1,29 May 2011,"This movie touches the hearts of many many Americans to this day. Not only will it stand the test of time, but it will remain in the hearts of many people throughout the world.This movie is so touching and moving that it makes you want to start balling right in front of everyone. Not only that, but it takes you on a thrill ride which will be unforgettable. The acting in this film is absolutely superb and could not have been any better. The casting was selected so perfectly and carefully that it could not have gone wrong. And of course the director, James Cameron, is without a doubt one of the most amazing directors I've ever seen. He manages to make you cry, but at the same time is able to keep your heart racing. Not many directors can pull this off.Another factor in this film which makes it so outstanding is the music. The music is very diverse in different parts of the movie. James Horner did an amazing job with the overall score. It can be either very suspenseful, or very soft and enlightening. And I don't know about you but when Celine Dion starts singing, there is no way that you can keep tears from staying in your eyes.Okay sure this film can make you cry, we know this. But this is one of the only love stories to date to absolutely horrify people. Some of the scenes where the ship is sinking are horrendous. The visual effects are exceptional for a 1990's film. They really do look real and create effects which are shocking to watch.Many people disagree that this is a remarkable movie just because it is not completely factual. Well guess what? Get over it. It was not made to be 100% accurate alright. It was meant to show the deep passion between two lovers and there willingness to save each others lives. For all you haters out there, we all know that you force your horrible opinions about a movie just so that you feel special. I mean who are you trying to kid? I know, you know, and America knows that this is one of the most mesmerizing and astonishing films ever made. This is an honorable movie and deserved each and every award that it got.I cannot tell you how much a cherish this film and all of its glory. It is an absolute necessity for any movie collection and is a landmark and role model for any good film to come. Not very many films will ever top it. If this film does not get your heart racing then you don't have one at all. And if this film does not move you as much as it moved me, then you don't know what a good movie is. It will go down in history as one of those epic movies. One that will never be forgotten. And all the haters, don't worry you'll come to your senses one day. Overall, a complete 10 out of 10. An incomparable masterpiece of epic proportions.",10/10
Excellent blend of a fictional love story and real life tragedy,SmileysWorld,2 October 2001,"I think that,as movie watchers,we all have at least one film that we wanted to like so much, that a disappointment would just be too much to handle.One such film for me was Titanic.Thankfully, it did not let me down,although the movie is not without it's imperfections.I'll talk about the great things first.Never has the ship been more masterfully recreated.I guess it took all this time to have the technology to do so.The special effects are indeed the best I have seen in any film.As for the acting, Billy Zane really steals the show from our two heroes,Leo and Kate,as the greedy,relentless Cal Hockley.Zane's performance is one of the better I have seen when it comes to villains.The recreation of the ship's final moments is spellbinding.The moment that touched my heart the most would have to be the ""Nearer My God to Thee"" scene.You are not human if this moment does not touch you to some degree.The only complaint I have with this film is the use of humor in some questionable places,For example,as Rose is battling to free Jack from his handcuffs and rescue him from certain doom,he utters the line,""I'll wait right here"".I certainly don't think one liners would be appropriate in that situation,though some may disagree.Overall, this film is a great blend of fiction and real life,and if you can sit still for three hours,I definitely recommend it.",9/10
Overblown,ThomasColquith,3 October 2021,"""Titanic"" is an overblown monstrosity which could have been great given tighter script, direction, and pacing. The film was easily an hour too long. That extra hour should have and could have been easily cut. As it is the film is a chore to get through and not a classic to revisit often; though the leads, Kate and Leonardo, have great performances, delivering a powerful romantic yarn, however these positives of ""Titanic"" are offset by the aforesaid over-indulgence in its own spectacle and grandiosity. This lack of self-restraint and efficient editing and storytelling really affect the second half of the film, making it almost unwatchable. Basically from the time the ship hits the iceberg the film suffers, it should have wrapped up with the catastrophe taking 20 minutes or so with a further 10 minute epilogue. But as it stands now at 3 and 1/4 hours it is obviously 60minutes too long. In summary, a famous film that probably appeals more to women, or young girls, than men, but it remains one of the great examples of a missed opportunity solely due to poor editing and pacing. My rating: 4/10. And the 100 year old lady should have been reciting the tale to her great-grandchild, not flying to a ship and telling a fortune hunter. That makes the film too long and even more preposterous.",4/10
A sinking feeling...,mikeg2,10 March 2002,"Take any cheesy love story worthy of Mills and Boon. Set it against one of the worst shipping disasters of modern times, being sure to pad the story out so the film overruns by at least two hours. Add in some ""ground breaking"" special effects, and you have yourself an Oscar-winning epic, 1997-style.Anachronisms abound. (Rose giving the ""finger"" - I half expected her to say ""kiss my ass!"") The ""class warfare"" angle is ridiculously overplayed, and just in case we *really* don't get it, no mention is made of the fact that the Titanic had classes of accommodation other than ""first"" and ""steerage"". Presumably the second class passengers spent the entire time below decks.When the truth doesn't fit the class agenda, Cameron simply makes it up - witness the steerage class passengers locked below decks while the toffs boarded the lifeboats, and the officer who murders several passengers before turning a gun on himself (a shameful fiction which did not please the real fellow's living relatives; Cameron was forced to apologise).""Titanic"" was condemned in some sections of the English press as an ""anti-English"" film. In truth, it's simply a lazy movie which exploits Hollywood clich√©s (hence the English-accented villains) and twists the truth to suit its own prejudices.In summary, ""Titanic"" is a dull, uninspired film which does the Titanic story a disservice. If this is the template that Cameron is using, I sincerely hope he doesn't have a ""9/11"" movie in the pipeline. ""Titanic"" could scarcely have been less credible if Cameron had filmed an all-out action adventure, with Arnie in the title role, and it would surely have been more entertaining!",No Rating
"Not exactly excellent, but a beautifully moving and epic film",gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,30 September 2012,"Back at the 90s when I was a little child, I loved all of the films that came out at the time, but I never heard of James Cameron before until at 2009, when that guy made his sci-fi epic ""Avatar"", I saw it and loved it as much as anyone else despite it's flawed story (loved the concept, by the way) and considered one of the best movies James Cameron has ever made since the first two Terminator movies (I've watched them and I thought they were completely epic) and Aliens. So, I decided to watch this on a VHS copy that I used to have until it vanished and I was officially moved by it.Before I could get to the positive aspects, I've heard some criticisms from other people who said that this is an extremely overlong and overrated film. Well, I will admit that this film does have some flaws, they're outweighed by it's redeeming qualities. The three hour length is longer, but I was impressed at how the it moves very quickly and the script, while staying true to the tragedy of the ship, has it's cheesy moments. The film looks very pretty and the look of the ship is beautiful. It also has some gorgeous costumes and very solid special effects. The music from James Horner is lovely and is one of his best scores in a feature film so far especially the heart-rendering song ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion and is one of the best music songs in cinema history.The direction from James Cameron is amazing and helps the story with complete focus while giving a intriguing atmosphere to it. The story is very rich in detail, gives the characters a lot of development perfectly and the love story, while obvious, is really moving. The strongest aspects, however, goes to the climax of the movie for has drama, heart, and comedy perfectly mixed together and a flawless cast to make the characters more interesting, emotive, and likable. Leonardo Di Caprio gives out one of his best performances as Jack Dawson, Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose, and Billy Zane is a great villain due to his deliciously cartoony and over-the-top performance. Other actors like Kathy Bates, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Bernard Hill, and more did well with their roles and the character development along with their interactions with the main characters were amazing.Overall, Titanic isn't nearly as excellent as James Cameron's previous films, but this is a beautifully moving and a 15-year old epic film that will always be recommended to others as one of the best movies ever made in cinema. With all my heart, this deserves a thumbs up from me.",8/10
Biggest Grossing Movie of all time,agmoldham,25 April 2004,"Whatever people think about this film it certainly had the magic ingredients at the box office. Even after all the Potter and Rings movies it's still grossed nearly twice as much as any other film.I can't imagine many people on the planet don't know what happened to the Titanic. The story is set around the unlikely romance between Jack and Rose. The film is pretty much split into two halves. The first is the romance between Jack and Rose, whilst the second is all about the boat going down. The effects are still very impressive and Leo and Kate look nice enough. Maybe it's not quite deserving of the Oscar glory and box office, but it's still a fairly entertaining movie. 8/10",6/10

Good movie but grossly overrated,johncairns-354-682933,5 May 2012,"Couldn't help but notice the number of posters that feel criticizing the movie-in any way-lumps you into a group of social misfits described as 'haters'. I thought the movie was fairly entertaining with outstanding special effects, but had a large problem with the lack of realism, especially ironic as Cameron 'got' most of the details correctly.The 'love story' was patently ludicrous, but probably the thing that drove the numbers at the box office, the treatment of historical figures like 'Molly' Brown-for example-was appalling, dripping with misogyny.With a little more even handed treatment the movie could have been outstanding and compelling to the degree that it actually deserved the Oscars it won that year, and still included a plausible romantic plot.",4/10
Not quite so popular anymore.,Jack the Ripper1888,8 December 2002,"Thought to be the most popular motion picture of all time by many, this film is probably also the most hated. Director James Cameron created an epic disaster story combined with a sloppily put together love story on the ill-fated, ""unsinkable"" R.M.S. Titanic. We all knew the story of TITANIC, so why did we all bother to go see it? We were curious about the events leading up to the disaster and I'm sure there were many who were interested in seeing the stupid love story.James Cameron wanted to make a love story. He said so himself. But, what he should have done was create a love story, and only a love story. But, no, he decided to combine his romance tale with the tragic story of Titanic. As soon as the iceberg hits, the story becomes just like an action-adventure movie with a little bit of love thrown in. And Cameron also dragged his stupid romance out for almost two hours before the real reason people went to see this movie happened. We all wanted a great movie about the story of Titanic, not a love story. How this film garnered so many damn Academy Awards is beyond me. I mean, a couple would have been understandable, but TITANIC won almost ALL of the awards, and I ain't kidding when I say 'all'.The cast was also all-star: Leonardo DiCaprio (if I was Cameron, I would have gotten someone else to play that part, as no one likes DiCaprio--this probably discouraged many people from seeing this film), Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, David Warner, Victor Garber, Bill Paxton, Danny Nucci,Jonathan Hyde, Bernard Fox and Jason Barrey lead the way in probably the biggest hit of all time...and the biggest flop.

"very very good, well worthy of the numerous Oscars it was awarded",cannonballsean1992,8 April 2008,"having been just five when Titanic was first released, i never got to see it in the cinema. i wish i had, because i know the magic, tension and pure brilliance that oozes from this movie would only be strengthened in the cinema. having seen the movie so many times, i know the plot very very well. despite this, i watch it every time it is on, simply because i know the experience i will get from it is brilliant.tension grips this movie, as the movie grips and pulls you in. relentlessly holding on until the heart wrenching climax. even then it stays with you. i never got bored during the movie, never once though, when will this be over. the experience is a fountain of enjoyment. the actors set this off, and they work well with the special effects, which add a true sense of realism, as though the audience is on the boat with them. you sit frozen, and are put in the position of Kate Winslet, shaking furiously at the locked gate, wading through the water, feeling the cold creep up, as you search for Jack, played amazingly by Leonardo DiCaprio. the sense of urgency and knuckle whitening tension is relentless, and this is what makes this movie so deserved of its awards, and its place in my memory.i know i am not alone when i say that this is an all time classic. such action can never be created again. despite its inevitable ending, you hope and pray for some sort of let up, allowing these characters to survive.one of my favourite movies ever. this movie simply never tires",10/10
You mean it sinks?!?,Knight_Shade,7 March 2003,"When I was in university, I remember seeing ""Jurassic Park"", and discussing it with a friend.  I commented on the loose plot, the silly dialogue, and the fact that it was a poor adaptation of a fairly entertaining novel. My friend's comment was, ""Yeah, but DUDE, you got to watch DINOSAURS!""  True enough, and for that, the film was well worth the cash.""Titanic"" is much the same.  The plot is the same old stuff you've seen before - poor boy meets rich girl promised to rich boy, rich girl falls for poor boy, rich boy tries to get rid of both.  Think ""Caddyshack"" on a boat. The acting is OK, given the silly dialogue and relentless attempts at tugging your heartstrings.  Here's the kicker: you get to see the ship go down.  In the comfort of your stadium seat or in your own home, you get to see what looks like the actual sinking of an ocean liner.  People screaming, tonnes of water everywhere, the best and worst of mankind in a tidy package for your viewing pleasure.  It's FRICKIN' COOL, is what it is.  It's some of the best eye-candy ever seen on film, and that's saying a lot.Remember DiCaprio's wonderful performances in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" or ""The Basketball Diaries""?  Yeah, you won't see any of that in ""Titanic"".""Titanic"" is less a movie than it is a rollercoaster.  I liken it to ""Pearl Harbor"" or ""Debbie Does Dallas"", where you get to see some mind-blowing action sequences, and the rest of the film is useless.  Rent the DVD so you can use chapter-select to replay the good stuff over and over.Now, you might be thinking I'm a mindless action freak, but nothing is further from the truth.  For those of you that heard ""Titanic"" is a wonderful and romantic flick, I recommend watching it, then renting ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""The English Patient"".  Both these films have better dialogue, better acting, and are MUCH more romantic than ""Titanic"" can ever be.Oh yeah, I almost forgot: two good reasons to watch ""Titanic"": Kate Winslet gets topless.",No Rating
Flawless 10 out of 10,boonhanlau,25 May 2013,"I gave it a 10 out of 10 because it deserves it. This legendary title came out when I was 1 year old. I didn't get to watch its premiere in the cinema, sad case. My parents have told me several times how good it was and my mom had watched it 3 times.When the 3D version came out, my family and I watched it together and it's really awesome. I could hardly believe they could make such a good film in 1990's. The special effects, the technology are just unbelievably good.On the other hand, the actors are real awesome. Leonardo Dicaprio, one of my favorite male actors. He did a marvelous job in the movie. He has such good acting at his age. He's the best actor in the film, imo.No matter how good the film is, don't watch it twice in a week... I went to watch it again with my friends and it's just too boring...seriously. I could clearly remember the whole story and what would happen next.So, overall. It's a must-watch film. I can't really understand why it's not in the IMDb top 250. It's unacceptable, seriously. It's a legend, man. I understand when there are lovers, there will be haters.This movie has a overall rating of 7.6 (at this moment), which is too low for a legendary film like this.

Amazing,kbgnphillips,20 May 2008,"'Titanic' is an excellent film by director James Cameron, and is a timeless classic. Titanic is very historically-accurate, yet the movie itself is also amazing.

Rose fall in love with a boy named Jack (Leonardo DiCapprio), to her mother's (and her fianc√©e's) great disapproval. The end is tragic and heartbrEaking, yet beautiful.

Awesome spectacle with magical chemistry between Kate and Leo,long-ford,26 January 2009,"On a recent viewing of Titanic, I realized that some of the Special Effects now look slightly dodgy.

Leo and Kate's tremendous chemistry makes it all worthwhile though. They absolutely convinced me they were in love.

The Best Films Of The 90's: Titanic,FloatingOpera7,24 August 2006,"Titanic (1997): Starring Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart, Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, Suzy Amis, Lewis Abernathy, Victor Garber, Bernard Hill, David Warner, Jonathan Hyde, Nicholas Cascone, Danny Nucci, Jason Barry, Johnny Phillips, Ewan Stewart, Ion Gruffud, Richard Graham, Eric Braeden, Michael Ensign, Bernard Fox, Charlotte Chatton, Rochelle Rose, Jenette Goldstein, Martin Jarvis, Rosalind Ayres, Alexandra Owens, Rocky Taylor, Gregory Cooke, Elsa Raven, Lew Palter, Richard Ashton, Oliver Page, Francisco Valdez, Ellen O'Brien, Lorenz Hasler, Thomas Furi, Ferenc Szedlak, Bela Szedlak, Werner Giger, Patrick Murphy, Stephen Wehmeyer, Shep Lonsdale, Ed Forsyth, Scott Hislop, Bobbie Bates, Kris Anderson, Samantha Hunt, Sean Nepita, Brendan Connolly, Martin Lang, Nick Meaney, Garth Wilton, Johnny Martin, Mike O'Neal, Steven Quale, Stephen Wolfe Smith...Director James Cameron, Screenplay James Cameron.""God himself could not sink this ship!!""..........To many 1997's ""Titanic"" was the definitive love story of the 1990's and now, almost 10 years later, it's still fondly remembered, even if the film has lost the powerful impact it once had and some people shamefully admit they cried in the end. This film was director James Cameron's greatest cinematic success, a larger-than-life, epic thriller romance brought to life by a strong cast and an overall expensive production. It came as no surprise that this beloved film swept the Oscars, earning the movie 11 Oscars including Best Picture. This one film made actor Leonardo DiCaprio a bankable star. James Cameron spent several years investing on this great project, recreating a model of the Titanic which he then sunk, hired costume designer Debora Lynn Scott, an expert on period fashion for 1912, haunting music by James Horner, production design by Peter Lamont, art direction by Martin Laing and cinematographer Russell Carpenter whose rich color and panoramic scenes establish an intense realism, especially in the latter portions. The hype surrounding the film ? Not only Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's chemistry as the lovers, but the powerfully emotional and human drama of surviving the most famous shipwreck in history. The film opens in the present day, where ambitious entrepreneur Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) unearths relics from the sunken Titanic, among them a sketching of a beautiful woman wearing a priceless diamond pendant, which is what he is really after. It belongs to Titanic survivor Rose Dewitt Bucater (played by ""Old Hollywood"" star Gloria Stuart) who is 100 something years old. She tells her story and we return to 1912, following the life of the characters on board that doomed voyage. Rose at age 17 (Kate Winslet) is a rich American girl on her way to Philadelphia to get married to millionaire Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane) whom she met at her university and has not truly fallen for. She is reluctant to marry or to take part of a stuffy lifestyle she finds meaningless, not because she wouldn't mind being wealthy but because it would mean being denied her personal freedom. These were sexist times and the movie clearly suggests this. Hockley may love Rose but he is not presented in a sympathetic light and is generally ruthless, arrogant and domineering. Rose's mother is a self-absorbed social climber who is pressuring her own daughter into a marriage of convenience without a thought to her daughter's personal happiness. When the desperately depressed Rose attempts suicide, American Jack Dawson (Dicaprio) saves her. The two strike up a romance, breaking social class barriers and provoking the wrath of Caledon Hockley. The last part of the film deals entirely with every single detail of the ship's demise from the minute it hits the iceberg to the minute it sinks, bottom's up, into the Atlantic waters. Impressive performances by minor characters such as Kathy Bates' Molly Brown, the only wealthy woman who was not a snob unlike the rest of the aristocratic brood, Jonathan Hyde's impetuous ship designer Bruce Ismay and Victor Garber's sensitive and resourceful Captain Andrews. This is a superb film and one that is sure to stir the soul every time you view it. Although it's quite long (longer than the standard 2 hour film), it is certain worth sitting through. Immerse yourself into the year 1912, journey across the Atlantic on that ill-fated maiden voyage and experience the passionate love of youth all over again. Perhaps the most rewarding aspects of the film is its verisimilitude. James Cameron knew enough about the Titanic to suffuse the film with such poignant realities as the elderly German-Jewish Strauss couple who refused to leave their bed and died in each other's arms, the Captain opting to go down with the ship, the orchestra playing on even while the ship sank, the issue of insufficient life boats and the irrepressible character of Molly Brown, who had won millions when her husband struck gold in Colorado, journeyed to Europe and returned home to America on the Titanic where she acted heroically by saving as many people as she possibly could. The real characters of John Jacob Astor, the richest man in America at the time, Guggenheim, and others. This film remains a wonderful and bittersweet tale of love and survival and a movie that represented the zenith of 90's cinema.",10/10
AMAZING!!! A must see!!!!,KatherineGM,5 October 2011,"'Titanic' is my favourite film for many reasons. 1. It has Leo DiCaprio (hottie!)in it ;-D 2. It is one of the most romantic love stories ever made 3. It is the one of the only films that has ever made me laugh and cry. 4. It touches your heart more than you'd ever want to admit. A lot of people dismiss this film, saying it's got rubbish acting, uninspired directing, overlong, whatever. I can guarantee that none of these things are true. Titanic truly is a masterpiece, a landmark in the history of film. I first saw this film last year. I'd heard about how good it was, but thought it might be a little disappointing. But honestly it was breathtaking. I won't say anymore, just go watch it. Watch. It. It is one of the best movies you will ever see. Maybe even the best.

"a weak, but at times truly incredible movie (a slight spoiler)",Catscanfly,15 March 2004,"Titanic is the sort of movie that you cannot critisize without mentioning its good parts, and cannot praise without recalling its dire ones. in many ways, it is very reminiscent of the old-style Hollywood romances- epic in length, enourmous in budget and popularity, weak in the eyes of some of its more critical viewers, and, fast destined for a high place in the most famous films of all time.Rose (Kate Winslet), a young, beautiful, upperclass and miserable passenger on the famously 'Unsinkable ship' (perhaps at this moment it would be good to point out that infact, contrary to popular belief, titanic was never in reality marketted as ""the unsinkable ship""... ahem, however) is disullsioned with life. Bearing this in mind, she makes a trip one evening to the stern (i think?) of the Titanic, climbs the railings, and prepares to jump into the freezing cold waters of the ocean below. As she prepares herself to jump, she is spotted by the equally young and beautiful, yet poor and freespirited artist Jack (leonardo Dicaprio), who manages to persuade her not to jump. And thus begins a beautiful friendship between the two- much to the distress and dissaproval of Rose's friends and family. Suprise, suprise, the relationship soon develops into sometihng more, and they become lovers. Just as their passionate love affair reaches steamy heights, the two become caught up, inevitably in the ship's sinking, and one of the greatest distaster sequences ever, ever filmed commences in the film's last hour: full of horror, tragedy, and terrible reality. The first two hours, driven by, concentrated on, and revolving around the romantic love affair between Rose and Jack, are clunking and thin. The script, while perhaps not dire, is certainly no masterpiece (written by the director, James Cameron) rather too full of cliche and annoyingly unsubtle messages designed perhaps to appeal to Cameron's conception of a modern audience's tastes (Rose, somewhat unconvincingly for the daughter of a conservative, upperclass, english society family, is an avid reader of Freud and waxes lyrical about Piccasso: ""It's like looking into a dream or something. there's truth but no logic."")this is perhaps too hard. some moments in these first two hours are lovely. I know that I might sound like a jackass for saying so, but in one of the truly iconic moments of romantic beauty that this movie, or indeed, any movie has to offer, what young girl was not lifted out of her cinema seat by that soaring, beautiful shot of the lovers at the ship's helm (i think? lol) at sunset? Dicaprio, a vastly underrated actor (and this movie might have something to do with that) as the inspired and inspirational young free spirit is at his most beautiful, boyish best, and manages to inject energy and charisma into a character who is sadly lacking in depth. (don't get me wrong, i loved him in this movie- being the hopeless romantic/ teenage girl i am....!) Winslet, another wonderful actress, is doing her best in her own role, but this is a more tricky one to make work: Rose is a character that makes a transition- from buttoned up, serious, posh ""spoilt brat"", as Jack names her, to impulsive, adventurous and sexually liberated young rebel chick. there is nothing wrong with this, of course, but the fact that even if we want to applaud her, we find her character extremely difficult to warm to, let alone grow to like or love. this has, however, probably never been a hinderance to what turned out to be definately a teen girl's movie- who was concentrating on Kate when we have Leo to look at? Other major characters include Rose's angry, idiotic, and completely villainous fiancee, Cal, who is determined to control Rose, in a way written to make any self respecting feminist's sight turn red with rage. Billy Zane plays the role in what i think is irony and humour, but the character is so poorly constructed, that even if this is so, his turn is far too broad and characturish, rather than a real performance of any kind. Also, there is Rose's mother (i'm not sure of the actress's name) another shameful steriotype (after watching this, i soon seriously started doubting if james Cameron's writing skills could ever possibly extend beyond borrowing a tragic historic event and placing a collection of cliches to bounce and react off one another in a ridiculous way) this time, of the cold, distant, and selfish mother, with little thought or feeling for others, and who is mainly motivated by money and rich husbands.(it's no wonder Rose was about to commit suicide, when placed in such company)However, this movie truly comes into it's own in when, as I mentioned, events reach their penultimate, inevitable conclusion, and that fateful night that the titanic collided with the Iceberg. In a gripping, heart wrenching hour long sequence, the love story finally takes back seat, and Cameron paints a portrait of the Titanic's last few hours above water. Indeed, this movie is well, well, WELL worth watching if only for this ending. I have never met someone who wasn't movied to tears by this film... however, i don't think i've ever met someone who was moved to tears by the love story's tragic conclusion. The fact that the enormity, horror and tragedy of the Titanic's sinking actually took place capsizes (forgive the allusion) the love story, which now more than ever feels synthetic, fake and trivial.No, the tears I shed for this film were for the musicians who played ""Nearer my God to Thee"" as the ship sank. My tears were for the Irish thirdclass woman and her two children, as she tucks them into bed for the last time, becuase she knows there are no life boats for them. my tears were for the old couple who lie in bed, together, peaceful, and ready for death. it is in these scenes that the film displays incredible, beautiful and tragic humanity and greatness.",No Rating
One of the best movies ever made.,Christian_Dimartino,5 July 2010,"In the 90's and 80's, director James Cameron was king of the world. Next to Steven Spielberg. He was a director that made groundbreaking motion pictures, like Spielberg. But did Spielberg make two of three of the top films ever made? No. Though Spielberg's films are a little better, Cameron's films are timeless.Cameron, who directed films like Avatar, Terminator and T2, should be most proud of 1997's best picture winning Titanic. Though Avatar was visually astonishing, it was no Titanic. Both films are dramas, both a little romance, both epic. But really? Can you top a film like Titanic?Titanic is one of the best films ever made. It truly is something beautiful. I know it's a little late to write a review about it but I have never appreciated it til now. I mean i'd always liked it but have never really loved it like I do now.I'm sure we all know how the film goes. Cause everyone has seen it. A group of researchers are looking for a necklace call""The heart of the ocean"". The person who has it is a 100 year old woman named Rose. While searching for the necklace, Rose tells the story of what happened to her while aboard ""The Titanic"".What happened? Well, Rose, at once engaged to a jerk(played by Billy Zane), falls in love with a poor boy named Jack(played by Leonardo DiCaprio). The two of them experience tons of things, even risking their lives for each other. Until the terrible crash on the iceberg. Titanic is a sweeping epic. It's beautiful, well acted, romantic, at first sad but now you'll probably get over it. The ending,for years, has made people angry. Eventually now we'll have to accept it. But that Rose is kind of a double crosser.Kate Winslet is a terrific actress,don't get me wrong. But she didn't deserve the nomination over Leonardo Dicaprio. The Oscars have cheated him many times. He deserves something I think. Especially for Gilbert Grape.Someday, he will receive something.The two actors had terrific chemistry together. That's why when they reunited for Revolutionary road,where instead of playing two lovers they play a couple that hates each other, I was surprised. I loved that movie too.Why did IMDb give it a rating it the 7's? I don't get it. This movie is flawless. I know it's long. But it doesn't matter. My favorite film, Magnolia, is 3 hours long too but I don't care. All great films are long. The best ones are long. Hence, why Titanic is one of the greatest films ever made. If you haven't seen it, there's something wrong with you. Titanic sweeps you.Titanic: 4/4*Note* I have just seen Titanic 3-D and it is still the spectacular film it was then... but possibly even better.",10/10
A Movie I Hate to Love,rockandroll432,8 April 2012,"I've never been into long movies. When a film starts growing longer than an hour thirty, perhaps an hour forty-five, I can't help but yawn and perhaps snooze off. It happened to me with the greatest movies in the history of cinema: I fell asleep with Gone With the Wind and yawned plenty of times with Schindler's List.But with Titanic, however, hours seemed to dash by without me noticing. I watched the story on screen, with my 3D glasses on, and I was instantly captured by Jack and Rose's story. Three hours twenty, nonetheless. And in all that time, I didn't let out a single yawn. Neither did I look at the time on my phone. I felt how the magic of Titanic really got to me, and when the credits came in my face was flooded with tears.Perhaps what I like the most about this movie is how it has made me feel. Yeah, it has made me feel things I had never felt before. For instance, I had never cried with a movie. And it wasn't just the sad romantic story that involved the two characters - but how all the characters that had interacted with them died one by one, sunk with the Ship of Dreams. Mr. Andrews, Captain Smith, little Cora, Mr. Murdoch, Tommy, Fabrizio...because Titanic isn't just a romantic movie, it's also a historic movie that shows what happened on a fatal April 14 morning, in 1912. One thousand fifty souls sunk down along with the Titanic into the deep waters of the Northern Atlantic, and I could see all that pain and suffering portrayed in James Cameron's movie perfectly. And it was during that dramatic hour, sitting still at the movie theater, in which tears dared to slide down my cheeks, along with most of the other viewers.As the movie credits slid by in the theater screen, my brother asked me if I was crying, and I shook my head. ""It's just the 3D glasses. You know, they get my eyes teary.""Yes, it might have very well been the 3D glasses. Or perhaps the fact that I had watched a great modern classic that will not be easily forgotten.",10/10
Best Movie in History,Veronica-5,30 July 1998,By far Titanic is the best movie ever made.  James Cameron is one of the best directors.  I am very glad that they casted Kate Winslet instead of Claire Danes.  Leonardo DiCaprio's acting was by far his best performance of his career.  I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL IT COMES OUT ON VIDEO!,No Rating
Thank god for the fire exit,mato-2,9 January 1999,"I didn't see the Titanic in the cinema when it opened, it was my pure pride not seeing the most comercial film of all times. But that after some time (3 months) I got a free ticket for a small cinema matinee. So I said screw it, let's see it. At the start it was OK but than soap opera started. Man, how can you stand to hear that BS all the time ?? Leo is dying, so what and he's doing it at least 30 minutes. And three hours long film, please ! The movie made for the little teenage girls, who go to cinema just to see the Di Crapio. The only good thing in the movie are the scenes, which are really cool made.",1/10
"I'm a guy. And yes, I cried. And so did you!",heathdicaprio,5 August 2020,"Oh, boy, I cried over this one. Only once before have I cried as much over a movie (Up). The build-up in this movie is matchless. The relationships formed are so powerful so that, at the very end, one is speechless and can't help but wonder what lovely adventures Jack and Rose were going to experience. Despite knowing the plot what with the ship sinking, Jack drowning etc., this movie is to me one of the most thrilling films of all time thanks to James Cameron and his detail-oriented brilliancy. DiCaprio and Winslet are exceptional in this movie and together, they form such a magical relationship that will make even the toughest of men believe in true love.",10/10
